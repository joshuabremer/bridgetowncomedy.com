Just picked up to TruTV as a series, Talk Show the Game Show showcases Guy’s mix of cultural observational comedy and personal narrative in a fun, quirky format. He’s known for strong takes, aggressive crowd work, and a willingness to share a bit too much of himself. 

Guy is best known for his appearances on Chelsea Lately, @Midnight, The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, and The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail. He’s also written for lots of TV shows including Another Period, Billy on the Street, The Mindy Project, and Awkward. He’s written culture and political commentary for Slate.com and The New York Times, and his pop culture roundtable podcast Pop Rocket was named one of the best new podcasts of 2015 by iTunes. Guy’s debut comedy album, Effable, was #1 on iTunes and Billboard charts, and The New York Times called it “a contender for the best comedy special of 2015.”
