This show concept is very simple.  Our host, Wendy Weiss, comes out and does the introduction.  She then introduces the Strip Master for the evening.  Our first comic comes out, and starts their material.  After a couple minutes, the Strip Master rings a bell.  The comic must now remove an article of clothing.  Then they continue with their set. Again, the bell rings. More clothing is removed. This happens every time the bell is rung, and it goes as far as the comic is willing to go.  Which, in many cases, is pretty far.  Every time clothing is removed, appropriate strip club music is played to enhance the mood.  Oh yeah, there is a spinner stripper pole installed on stage for some good amateur pole work.  The show features 5 comics, one at a time.  This number could vary. There are also typically door prizes given away, which include certificates for a free lap dance from participating local strippers, or custom made butt plugs bearing the image of the headlining comic&#039;s face.
