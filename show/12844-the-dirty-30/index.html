From the producers of the multi-city, critically acclaimed showcase &quot;50 First Jokes&quot; comes &quot;The Dirty 30!&quot; Watch thirty of the finest comedians in the land each present their absolute filthiest jokes, all on one mega-show. Not for the faint of heart, &quot;The Dirty 30!&quot; encourages comics to reach into the recesses of their souls and find the most disrespectful, disturbing and NC-17 material they can muster. The show brings together fresh faces with alternative comedy legends. Performers have been featured on Comedy Central, Letterman, Fallon, Conan, College Humor and more. John F. Oâ€™Donnell (Redacted Tonight) plays host to this cringe-worthy showcase.
