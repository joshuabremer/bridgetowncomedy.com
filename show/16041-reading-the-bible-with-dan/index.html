Reading the Bible with Dan is what you really wished your Sunday School class would have been like.

It's Tough Crowd Meets The 700 Club

Imagine a bible study group ran by a foul mouthed roadie for Motorhead who is stunned by the level of holy shit he is reading plus a panel of 12 people (4 at a time because I'm not crazy) who want nothing more then to turn the world’s most revered book into a profane joke collection.

That’s what the show is plus a few moments of genuine information thrown in for bad measure, usually in cubits.

Everyone who has ever done the show has asked to do it again.

I read a selected story from the Bible verse by verse.

The panel and I make fun of what I just read.

For Bridgetown this year it would be Adam and Eve plus Cain and Abel.

There really isn't another show like it anywhere.
