This is an improv comedy show that uses the audience members&#039; personal playlists on their portable music devices as a soundtrack to the show. A DJ collects their devices before the show, mines them for music during the show, then returns them after the show. The DJ plays songs from the playlist which inspires improv scenes, or highlights the scenes. 

There are 4 members of The Liberators, but we would LOVE to include guest improvisers from the festival.
The main improv troupe will be: The Liberators.
The Liberators have been described as &quot;one of the best improv troupes anywhere&quot; (Portland Mercury) and have been bringing their signature brand of sexysmart improv comedy to Portland and beyond for over 10 years.

Shelley McLendon (Owner: Siren Theater and  Bad Reputation Productions)
John Breen (Upright Citizens Brigade)
