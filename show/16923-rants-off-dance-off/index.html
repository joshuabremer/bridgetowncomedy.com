Rants Off / Dance Off is a comedy game show where comedians compete in a battle of vulnerabilities both verbal and physical! Contestants offer their heated opinions on subjects--some prepared, some improvised--and then, like ice cream to a hot pepper so foolishly eaten whole, sooth their raw nerves by dancing their hearts out. Judgement is summarily doled out panel-style. Winners receive little but pride and regrets. Great fun is had by all!

Rants Off / Dance Off has been a part of Bridgetown, All Jane Comedy Festival, and Bumbershoot. Hosted by Whitney Streed with musical direction by Manuel Hall.
