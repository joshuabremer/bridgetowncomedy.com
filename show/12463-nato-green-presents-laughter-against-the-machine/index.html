Laughter Against the Machine launched in 2008 in San Francisco by Nato Green &amp; W. Kamau Bell. It explodes the concept of political comedy, offering a show where the comedians and the audience to expect to be challenged, to laugh, and think at the same time. It&#039;s an issue-oriented, no-holds-bar show with no preconceived expectations, no party lines, and certainly no cheerleading - showcasing comics who have beef with everybody, including themselves.

Over the years, LATM has toured nationally, and featured such comedians as Margaret Cho, Janine Brito, Jimmy Dore, Hari Kondabolu, Aparna Nancherla, Hasan Minhaj, Maria Bamford, Moshe Kasher, Will Durst, Baratunde Thurston, Emily Heller, Marcella Arguello, and more.
