Roderick on the Line is a frank and candid weekly phone call between John Roderick and Merlin Mann. While these sorts of calls have been conducted privately on a regular basis since something like 2003, they are now being made available to the public as an audio podcast.

John Roderick is a singer, songwriter, journalist, and raconteur based in Seattle, Washington. He and Merlin are friends. Johnâ€™s best known for his extensive eyeglasses collection, his luxuriant facial hair, and his career as the man behind the critically-lauded indie rock band, The Long Winters.

Merlin Mann is an independent writer, speaker, and broadcaster based in San Francisco. He and John are friends. Merlin created 43 Folders, co-hosts You Look Nice Today, Back to Work, and Roderick on the Line, and speaks and consults about things like email, time &amp; attention, and creative work.
