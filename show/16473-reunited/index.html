Reunited! brings together the casts of beloved sitcoms for in-depth panel discussions, Q &amp; A sessions, and table-reads of classic scenes.

 

The catch? The shows never existed, except in the minds of hosts/show-creators Josh Androsky and Bryan Cook.  Additionally, none of the guests have any prior knowledge of the series they “starred” on.

 

Cook and Androsky create a fictionalized world where a panel of comics discuss personal issues, professional pitfalls, and brushes with the law. It would be the most scandalous show in Hollywood if any of it had ever happened.
