Hello! I struggled with which show to submit but figured since Midnight Mass is so late and can accomodate so many sets, it was a better bet (Also Whitney gave me advice).Â The 2016 turnout was PACKED, even in extreme Analog heat, and for the most part we were able to draw our old Midnight Mass/ Amy Miller fan crowd. My pitch is that it's FUN, people love it, and it's only mildly themed but also another straight standup set for everybody!
