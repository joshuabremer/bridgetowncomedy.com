No. You&#039;ve just found yourself in 2016 where black people are actively redefining &quot;black people&quot;. So sit back and enjoy while we welcome you...to the New Negroes.

&quot;New Negro&quot; is a term popularized during the Harlem Renaissance to imply an outspoken intellectual departure from long-standing racist ideology and institutions.
