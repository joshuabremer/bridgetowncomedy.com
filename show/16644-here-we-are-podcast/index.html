Here We Are – Live! 

Each week on the Here We Are Podcast stand-up comedian Shane Mauss travels the country interviewing scientists about their work and the meanings of life.  Shane uses his non-academic, “every-man” approach to learn about some of the most important research and ideas about life in a highly accessible, funny, and interesting way.  Listeners get to eavesdrop on Shane’s journey to figure out why we are here, why we behave the way we do, and what to do about it.  The aim is to look at life in as many different ways as possible to better understand ourselves and have a few laughs along the way.

In special live episodes, we better connect scientists to the public in fun ways.  It gives audiences an opportunity to have a more unique live entertainment experience and ask scientists questions of their own.  This is not a pretentious event.  This is a very fun and casual setting where people of all ages and backgrounds are invited to have some drinks, learn, laugh, and meet other intellectually curious people in the area.
