Leviathan is storytelling + improv
This is basically the improv format called the Armando: a group of improvisers do scenes based on personal stories told by a person of note. The improvisers would be mostly made up of the Siren Theater house team of improvisers, but we would love to include other improvisers from the festival. We would also love to ask other festival performers to be the storytellers.  There are typically 1-2 storytellers per show)
