Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction with Bryan Cook is a live show and popular podcast on the Nerdist Network. It has been recognized as one of the top shows in LA by LA Weekly and listed in the Top 20 Comedy Podcasts by Rolling Stone. The LA show, held every month at the Virgil, recently celebrated its third anniversary. Each show features two rounds of comics, writing and performing Erotic Fan Fiction pieces, based upon their whims or audience suggestions. Itâ€™s really stupid.
