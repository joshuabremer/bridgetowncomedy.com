Comedians face off in series of one-on-one rap battles -- totally freestyle, totally improvised. The audience decides the winner by applause at the end of every round, until we have one final champion. It&#039;s like 8 Mile, but funny.

Past competitors include Reggie Watts, TJ Miller, Childish Gambino, Thomas Middleditch, Pete Holmes, MC Chris, Nicole Parker, Megan Amram, and like a billion other people.

Hosted by Eliza Skinner.
