You guys know about Picture This! since it&#039;s been used as a reference for show submissions for the last few years. But the show has grown and refined in the last 4 years since we did the show at Bridgetown. We would love a chance to come back to Bridgetown like some of the other theme shows like Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction as our show is 100% unique every time we put the show on based on new comedian and animator mixes. We also had a PDX franchise of the show (ended at the end of 2015) so we have a strong base of animators and fans of the show that we would bring to the festival if we were doing a show for the festival. Brandie, Mike, Mike and I would really love to bring the live animated comedy sensation that Tig Notaro, the SF Sketchfest crew, the RIOT LA crew, the BoJack Horseman creators and more have enjoyed enough to bring them to their festivals and brands. Below is the rest of the updated info on the show:

Picture This! has been going on monthly for over 5 years in Los Angeles with both the regular monthly show and special sponsored shows with sponsors like Bento Box Entertainment, Comedy Central’s Brickleberry, Adult Swim’s Mr. Pickles, Netflix’s BoJack Horseman, Cartoon Network and more!
