Comedy Legend Bobcat Goldthwait and Caitlin Gill (Take My Wife writer, also Bobcat's roommate) gather some of the most eclectic personalities around, and bring together a comedy/variety show that celebrates everyone's own wierdness and individuality. Its common to find Drag Queens, Standups, Poets, and modern dancers all on one show, while tieing together a common theme. 

Named one of the best local shows in Los Angeles by LA WEEKLY, Crabapples has sold out at SF Sketchfest and RIOT LA Fest this year, and will be touring this year!
