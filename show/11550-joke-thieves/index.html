It&#039;s Comedy Set Swapping LIVE!   The show where comedians perform their own jokes, then each others&#039;.   Will it be a car crash or an improv masterclass?   The fun is in the finding out.

The show has enjoyed three sell-out runs at the Edinburgh Fringe (2013 - 2015), regular packed houses at it&#039;s U.K. comedy club residencies (Downstairs @ The King&#039;s Head, London &amp; The Stand, Edinburgh) and huge successes overseas in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Norway, Iceland, Austria and the U.S. The format is currently being adapted for television by the team at the Comedy Unit (part of Zodiac Media) and has been made into a BBC2 television pilot in the U.K. Outside of the U.K. the show is being developed in conjunction with ICM Partners.
