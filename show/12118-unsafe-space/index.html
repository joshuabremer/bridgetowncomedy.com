Comedians do standup on controversial topics, followed by a response by experts and a discussion with the audience. It's an environment where people of different views can be outspoken but respectful and the humor makes it a fun experience for everyone. We started the show amidst debate about the free speech of comedians vs. the right of the audience to respond to things they disagreed with. We want to bring everyone into the same room instead of talking past each other online. We want comedians to be able to say whatever they want on hot-button issues, and experts and the audience free to voice their opinions as well, with the result of a fun, stimulating and real conversation. Example shows: * Islam, featuring Jihad Turk (president of President of Bayan Claremont Islamic Graduate School), Heina Dadabhoy (ex-Muslim blogger), Mitch Burrow (comedian and USMC veteran), and Aron Kader (comedian from the "Axis of Evil" comedy tour). * Guns, featuring Joshua Stepakoff (Board member of Women Against Gun Violence and mass shooting survivor), Adam Winkler (UCLA Constitutional Law professor), Ed Greer (Comedian and former NRA member) and Katie Massa Kennedy (writer for the Queen Latifah show and activist). The show is recorded as a podcast and hosted by Lou Perez and Toby Muresianu.
