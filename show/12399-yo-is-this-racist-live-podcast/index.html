The Yo, Is This Racist? Podcast is a daily podcast offshoot of the blog of the same name, with the very simple premise: Ask host Andrew Ti if something is racist, and he&#039;ll tell you. The podcast typically has a writer/comedian guest and Andrew, taking a call-in question from a fan about any and all aspects of racism, or potential racism, in pop culture, politics, the Internet, and sometimes, just from some asshole at work. The tone of the show is as light as the subject matter allows funny people time to address serious issues in a way that doesn&#039;t need to be preachy or pedantic, and can be fun.
