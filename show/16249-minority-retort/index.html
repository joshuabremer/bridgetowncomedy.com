Minority Retort is one of Portland’s most popular and critically acclaimed comedy shows and celebrates diversity like none other. Hosted by comedian Jeremy Eli and co-produced by writer/radio show host Jason Lamb, Minority Retort&#039;s goal is to provide comedians of color with a platform to speak their minds and share their unique perspectives, as well as reach the multicultural comedy audience that exists within the so-called &quot;whitest city in America&quot;. Nationally recognized comedians such as Baron Vaughn (Netflix’s Grace &amp; Frankie), Janine Brito (FX’s Totally Biased), Zainab Johnson (HBO)  and Maggie Maye (Conan) have performed on the show, as well as many comics frequently featured in Portland&#039;s Bridgetown Comedy Festival: Nathan Brannon, Bri Pruett, Elicia Sanchez, Anthony Lopez, Curtis Cook, Adam Pasi, David Mascorro, and Katie Nguyen. 

Minority Retort is also a part of XRAY FM radio’s morning show Fridays at 8:40am.
