Seven Minutes in Purgatory is a comedy show produced by Ian Abramson and Matt Byrne.Â Standup comedians perform their material directly to a camera alone in a soundproof room while the audience watches on a screen in another room. "What's interesting about this experiment is that for the comics, each of their jokes are given equal weight since there are no laughs as far as the standup is concerned. This gives the comic full license to experiment. It's outrageous." - The Chicago Tribune
