In Reading the Bible With Dan Live, Dan Weber and his comedy writing partner “The Bible” and his co-host Nariko Ott dissect the most popular stories found in the wacky insanity that is America&#039;s Most Revered Book. We read stories such as Adam and Eve getting thrown out of the garden of Eden; Noah&#039;s Ark and the flood; Cain and Abel; Jacob tricking Issac to become the father of the nation of Israel, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  Joining them is a rotating panel of comics who comment on each and every crazy thing read. 

Panelists have included Amy Miller, Christian Ricketts, Whitney Streed and Kristine Levine.

Musical accompaniment provided by Ira Novos.

It&#039;s slightly informative and super hilarious.

Additionally, the live show has a drinking game named &quot;Behold!&quot; Every time that word is used in the Bible, the audience takes a drink. This happens way more than it really should.

There really isn&#039;t anything else like it.

For the Bridgetown show we would read about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah because that story is absolutely insane.
