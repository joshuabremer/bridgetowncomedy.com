REUNITED! Brings together the casts of beloved sitcoms for in-depth panel discussions, Q &amp; A sessions, and table-reads of classic scenes.

The catch? The shows never existed, except in the minds of hosts/show-creators Josh Androsky (Spongebob Square Pants) and Bryan Cook (Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction.) Oh, and none of the guests have any prior knowledge of the series they supposedly “starred on.”
