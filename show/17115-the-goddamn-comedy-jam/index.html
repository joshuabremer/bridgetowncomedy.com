Stand-up comedian Josh Adam Meyers along with the Goddamn Band, host the premiere comedy event: The Goddamn Comedy Jam (#GDCJ). A killer lineup of comedic entertainers come together to rock the stage and the mic in the only show that proves: every comedian wants to be a rock star.

The Goddamn Comedy Jam is the intersection of comedy stardom and rock &amp; roll dreams. Comedians perform a stand up set and short story followed by a song of their choosing, accompanied by a live band. It is an unprecedented opportunity to shine as both a comedic star and rock God in the electrified atmosphere that can only be found at The Goddamn Comedy Jam.

This show is a separately ticketed even at Crystal Ballroom on Thursday, May 4th. Tickets are on sale at http://www.crystalballroompdx.com/events/168154-The-Goddamn-Comedy-Jam

THE COMEDY JAM premiered on Comedy Central March 22.
