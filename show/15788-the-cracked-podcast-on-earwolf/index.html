The Cracked Podcast is an extension of the Cracked.com editorial team discussions that shape the brilliant articles and sketches on Cracked. Co-Hosts Jack Oâ€™Brien (editor-in-chief of Cracked.com) and Michael Swaim along Cracked staff members and with an impressive roster of guests, use the platform to identify and dissect pop culture tropes, debunk myths. The show is the third most listened to podcast on the Earwolf network. We do a live show every month at the UCB Sunset theater in LA and have managed to sell out every show this year. This past year we have also tried to incorporate more local up and coming comedians in to our show to bring us more levity within the comedy community. We have also boosted many guests podcasts, books, and other creative endeavors just by having them on the show.  Here is a link to the podcast archives: http://www.cracked.com/podcast/
