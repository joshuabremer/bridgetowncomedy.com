Lance Bangs is a Pacific Northwest institution, and a legend in the worlds of music and comedy. As a filmmaker and music video director he’s created videos for Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Neutral Milk Hotel, Green Day, Arcade Fire, The Shins, The Thermals, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Menomena, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, R.E.M., Mike Watt, Death Cab for Cutie, The Black Keys, Kanye West, Odd Future, and Pavement. He directed the David Cross film Let America Laugh, and he’s been heavily involved in the filming and production of MTV&#039;s Jackass television series and its subsequent movies. Most recently he’s directed Viceland’s Flophouse—a series where he follows the lives of up-and-coming comedians at underground stand-up events.

With a body of work like that, Lance has an incredible catalog of rarely-seen footage, and for years he’s combined screenings of these gems from his personal library with top-notch standup comedy from the biggest names in the Bridgetown Comedy Festival in his show Come Laugh With Us. This is a can’t-miss night of rarities and special guest performances!
