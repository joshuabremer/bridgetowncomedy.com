<h3>Thank you!</h3>

Bridgetown had a great ten-year run, and we're grateful to the hundreds of performers and thousands of fans who made it such a fun decade. We're putting the festival on hiatus for 2018, but it may come back in the future. If so, we'll be sure to keep everyone posted via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bridgetown), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bridgetowncomedy/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bridgetowncomedy/), which are also great places to check out recaps and photos from the past ten years of Bridgetown.
