An Emmy-nominated television writer, Andres is currently in Los Angeles writing for Conan, TBS’ new primetime talk show premiering in November. Andres was a staff writer for The Tonight Show With Conan O’Brien, after joining the staff of Late Night With Conan O’Brien for the end of their run. Prior to that, he spent two seasons as a staff writer for Talkshow With Spike Feresten, sandwiched around a brief stint at Best Week Ever.

Andrés du Bouchet has been writing and performing his unique brand of comedy in New York City since 1997. He recently wrapped his long-running and popular weekly show Giant Tuesday Night Of Amazing Inventions And Also There Is A Game, and has appeared in sketches on Late Night With Conan O’Brien, Tough Crowd With Colin Quinn, and Cheap Seats. He is also a featured player in the I Love The 30s and All Access Middle Ages series on Comedy Central’s Motherload. Du Bouchet’s unique characters, monologues, sketches and absurdist style make him hard to miss, as do his loudness and size.
