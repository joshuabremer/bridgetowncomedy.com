If Caitlin Weierhauser had a gender it would be, &quot;PE Teacher&quot; but alas, this Portland comedian refuses a reasonable label. Often political, frequently personal, rather observational and entirely too tantrum-prone, Caitlin serves arguments with equal parts glee and rage. They deliver the worst news about society with a dimpled grin and pointed outbursts. 

Caitlin has performed at Pickathon, Bumbershoot, Seattle Sketchfest, All Jane Comedy Fest, and was voted Top 5 in Willamette Week&#039;s 2016 poll. Comedy masterpieces include; Lez Stand Up, Dinner Date with Nick &amp; Cait, You&#039;re Welcome, Queer Story Jam, Room of Requirement 237 (A Harry Potter Podcast), and they are a regular co-host for XRAY in the Morning on XRAY.fm.
