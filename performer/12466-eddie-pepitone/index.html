Nicknamed “The Bitter Buddha”, comedian Eddie Pepitone is a master of the dark art of comedy. Hailed as a modern day cross between Jackie Gleason, Don Rickles, and Eckhart Tolle, Eddie is a force of nature onstage, switching between social rage and self- doubt. His shows are an energetic combo of calm and chaos, blue-collar angst and sardonic enlightenment. On the television front, he has been a mainstay on American broadcast and cable networks and currently recurs on "Community", "Bob’s Burgers", "Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell" on Adult Swim, and "Conan". Other notable turns include "Arrested Development", "The Flight of the Conchords", "It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia", "House MD", "Chappelle’s Show", and two seasons of "Last Comic Standing", and "The Sarah Silverman Program".
