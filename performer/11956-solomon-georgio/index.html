Solomon Georgio burst out of the Seattle comedy scene with his own brand of indignant irreverence. He flawlessly intertwines biting social commentary with stories of his life as an openly gay African immigrant. 

Solomon recently had his television debut in February 2015 as the featured comedian on &quot;CONAN&quot;, and immediately followed it up with an appearance on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. He is also the host of several episodes of Viceland&#039;s &quot;Flophouse&quot;.
