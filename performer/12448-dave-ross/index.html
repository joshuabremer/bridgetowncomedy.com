Dave Ross is a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles. Sometimes his comedy is vulnerable and personal. Other times his comedy is loud, stupid and about butts. You can find him stumbling around L.A. and the country, performing at every festival, club, theater, bar, fire hall or bombed-out stone building that will have him. He&#039;s in a sketch group called WOMEN that makes sketches for Comedy Central and IFC&#039;s Comedy Crib. He hosts the podcast Terrified on the Nerdist Network. He won a MOTH Grand Slam, he got interviewed on WTF with Marc Maron, and he told a story on Comedy Central&#039;s Drunk History. He likes his cat. His cat&#039;s dope.
