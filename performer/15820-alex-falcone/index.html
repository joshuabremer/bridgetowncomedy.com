Alex Falcone is a comedian, writer, and moderately snappy dresser from Portland, OR. He&#039;s a regular on the IFC show Portlandia, has appeared at numerous comedy festivals including Bumbershoot, Sketchfest, Laugh Your Asheville Off, and the Brooklyn Comedy Festival, and he was named one of the Willamette Week&#039;s Funniest 5 and the Mercury&#039;s Undisputable Geniuses of Comedy.

His writing has been quoted in Rolling Stone, VOX, Boing Boing, and been featured on the front page of Reddit. He recently released his debut novel &quot;Unwrap My Heart&quot; about a girl who falls in love with a very sexy mummy.

In 2015, ice cream legends Salt &amp; Straw named a flavor after him and it was delicious.

Despite these modest accomplishments, he somehow remains totally down to earth and approachable.
