San Francisco magazine describes Kate Willett as “a comedian you should know about,” so here’s the info: You can catch her Comedy Central debut this winter on &quot;This Is Not Happening.&quot; She’s a regular feature for Margaret Cho who she’s toured with nationally and internationally.  You might have seen her on Fusion TV or heard her on the Risk! podcast with Kevin Allison. She’s appeared in the 2015 Just for Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, Limestone Comedy Festival, and San Francisco Sketchfest (4 years in a row). 

She was recently named one of the top &quot;Artists to Watch in 2016&quot; by the SF Weekly, has opened for comedians like Kyle Kinane, Jen Kirkman,  Anthony Jeselnik, Dana Gould, Jackie Kashian, Myq Kaplan, and Michael Che, and produces four of the best alternative comedy shows in the city including “The Mission Position” at Lost Weekend Video which CourtingComedy.com calls “the next great tradition in San Francisco Comedy.”

 She’s a regular feature at comedy clubs all over the country and a favorite of audience members, flannel clad skateboarders, and all of her twenty-three roommates.
