Clara is an internationally-unknown stand-up comedian: one of the few humorists to be unknown in the entire world! 

Clara was raised in both the French Alps and Germany before she attended college in South Carolina; as you do when you come from France. 

Clara’s humor is witty and observational and comes with a European twang. 

Clara has appeared in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition, SF SketchFest, the Charleston Comedy Festival, the Montreux Comedy Festival, the San Diego Comedy Festival… She’s performed with Robin Williams, Tom Papa, Paul Reiser, Laurie Kilmartin, Anne Roumanoff &amp; many more.

She was once stranded for hours on a broken escalator due to a power outage.
