If you haven't heard yet, the Denver comedy scene is blowing up and comedian Troy Walker is one of the most talented local rising stars.

Troy Walker has quickly become one of Denver's most sought-after comedians, a designation he'd dismiss with a modest scoff, despite its accuracy. A regular at Comedy Works, Walker has won the Comedy Works "New Faces" contest twice.

Walker has had the pleasure of opening for some of the most  prominent comedians in the country and also serves as a fine ambassador of Denver comedy at national and local comedy festivals including The Aspen Rooftop Comedy Festival, The Great American Comedy Festival, The Laughing Skull Comedy Festival, Portland's Bridgetown Comedy Festival, The Telluride Comedy Festival, and most recently as one of Just for Laughs Montreal's New Faces of Comedy.

After witnessing his storytelling abilities and commanding  presence on-stage it should come as no surprise that he's also a licensed attorney  who graduated  from The University of Denver's Sturm College of Law.
