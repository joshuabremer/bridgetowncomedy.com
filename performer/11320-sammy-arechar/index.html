Born and raised in Wisconsin, Sammy Arechar is a bad boy. His sense of humor and his stage presence that is often described as &quot;personified chicken salad&quot; has landed him gigs opening for nationally touring comedians such as T.J. Miller, Matt Braunger, Garfunkel and Oates, Johnny Pemberton, Josh Fadem, Moshe Kasher, and Ari Shaffir, along with festivals such as the Milwaukee Comedy Festival, the 2014 Comedy Exposition of Chicago, Riot LA, and the Limestone Comedy Festival. His hobbies, along with telling jokes on stage, are looking handsome, seeing what&#039;s on TV, and seeing what&#039;s in the fridge.
