Dusty Slay is a stand-up comedian with a baritone voice so smooth it&#039;s like champagne in your ears. 

Slay has appeared on several network shows including NBC’s &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;, the popular program &quot;Laughs on FOX&quot; and he was a featured comedian on &quot;TMZ&quot;.  

Dusty&#039;s comedy is regularly showcased on many nationally syndicated radio programs including Sirius XM, Pandora Radio and &quot;The Bob and Tom Radio Show&quot;. He’s also been invited to numerous comedy festivals across America including: The Laughing Skull Festival, The Charleston Comedy Festival and The Cape Fear Comedy Festival. Dusty won both the &quot;Fight Night Competition&quot; and the “Almost Famous Competition” at the Charlotte Comedy Zone in 2014.  During his years in Charleston, SC Slay won The Charleston Comedy Festival Stand Up Competition two years in a row and was voted &quot;Best Local Comic&quot; by the readers of the Charleston City Paper in 2013 and 2014.

Dusty was born in Alabama, his parents divorced when he was two, then there was a custody battle, his mom lost, so he had to go live with her. He split time between his dad who lived on a farm, and his mom who lived in a trailer park. When asked about his education, Slay says, “When I was kid, my dad asked me if I wanted to go to college or if I wanted a pool. Man, I love that pool.”

Dusty Slay is based in Nashville, TN where he is a local favorite at his home club at Zanies and has opened for many touring celebrities such as Rob Schneider, Jeff Ross and Roseanne.  Dusty, however, spends most of his time on the road where he continues to make audiences laugh all over the country at comedy clubs such as: The Punchline and Laughing Skull in Atlanta, Crackers Comedy Club in Indianapolis, The Charlotte Comedy Zone, Funny Bone Clubs (Syracuse, NY; Albany, NY; Virginia Beach, VA; Richmond, VA; Toledo, OH; Columbus, OH; Dayton, OH; Des Moines, IA), Comedy Club on State in Madison, WI, The Improv (Tampa, FL; Kansas City, MO) as well as many other clubs.

In 2014, Dusty released his debut comedy album “Makin’ That Fudge” which can be found at CDBaby.com, Amazon.com and ITunes and is featured on Sirius XM.

Dusty&#039;s new album &quot;Son of a Ditch&quot; will be released later this year.
