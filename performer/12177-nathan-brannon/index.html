Nathan is a comedian out of Portland, Oregon, who is consistently adding to his list of accomplishment year after year.  Just a month into 2016, Nathan recorded his second album with Kill Rock Stars Recording, set to be released mid 201. He also signed with Kill Rock Stars in 2015, was the winner of the Seattle International Comedy Competition in 2014, voted into the Willamette Week&#039;s &quot;Portland&#039;s Funniest 5&quot; in 2013 while releasing his first comedy album &quot;I Black Out&quot; that same year, and was crowned “Portland’s Funniest Person” in 2012. Nathan has also opened for national headliners such as Dave Chappelle, David Alan Grier, Maria Bamford, and has photoshopped himself into photos with many more. Currently, Nathan is seeking a funnier way to end this paragraph.

In addition to his stand-up, Nathan is the host of The Hamster Village; a podcast about Interracial Relationships, where he interviews interracial couple &amp; individuals about their experiences in a racially-charged society. He has been featured on programs such as NPR&#039;s Weekend Edition, Laughs on Fox, and NBC&#039;s Grimm.
