Ella thinks the best comedy is like an open house in another person’s brain, and she would like to invite you into hers. In May 2015 she took 3rd in the Funniest Person in Austin competition. Described by the Austin Chronicle as “exceedingly clever”, her jokes run the gamut from honest to absurd. She has performed at the Orlando Indie Comedy Festival, Hell Yes Fest, and the She Devil Comedy Festival. She co-hosts Naughty Bits, a sold-out Austin show where she gives comedians sex advice based on their jokes, and she writes and performs sketch with the eclectic, talented weirdos of Comedy Bazaar.
