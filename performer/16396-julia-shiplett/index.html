Beginning comedy in her hometown of Chicago, Julia Shiplett has been performing standup and telling stories for the past four years. Her comedy has evolved into a seamless blend of feminism, self-deprecation and personal experiences as a biracially confused Midwesterner. She often explores key topics like pop culture, women&#039;s issues and gross things happening to her body.

She has been seen in the Brooklyn Comedy Festival, Hell Yes Fest, Cinder Block Comedy Fest and the Chicago Women’s Funny Fest. Other credits include winning a Moth StorySLAM and making it to the 2015 StandUp NBC semifinals. 

Now in New York, Julia co-produces two popular comedy shows in Brooklyn called DEVOUR HOUR &amp; Side Ponytail.

She’s been told she would make an adorable villain.
