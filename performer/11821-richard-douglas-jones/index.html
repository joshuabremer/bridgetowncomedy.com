Memphis-born comic, Nerd Culture Enthusiast, and Black Nerd Power Podcast Host,

Richard Douglas Jones started performing at open mics in Memphis to recover from

depression, after a succession of hapless happenings left him more than slightly

misanthropic. He found deliverance in comedy and audiences found his wildly

inappropriate and caustic wit hilarious. Both a nice guy and a dubious miscreant, his

delivery is a mash up of incisive insights on everyday life, Nerd Culture from a Black

POV, dating, sex, politics, and race. 

RDJ is what happens when one guy finds his tribe of weirdos and let&#039;s his Freak Flag

proudly fly!
