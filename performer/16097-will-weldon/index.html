Will Weldon is a comedian who has come to recognize the futility in putting a lot of effort into writing a bio. He&#039;s performed all across North America; at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival (twice, bragging), on Comedy Central&#039;s This Is Not Happening, and on such well known live comedy shows as The Meltdown w/Jonah &amp; Kumail, Big Terrific, Put Your Hands Together, and Whiplash. Patton Oswalt said he was a &quot;comic you don&#039;t know and should be YouTubing.&quot; Will looks forward to performing where and whenever, because it gets him out of the house.
