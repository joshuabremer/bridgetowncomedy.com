Originally hailing from St. Louis (a fact he can’t stop bringing up.) Marcus Coleman was named of Portland’s “Geniuses of Comedy” by the Portland Mercury, he was also chosen to perform in their sold out showcase at the remarkable Revolution Hall.

A laid back shit-talker with a smile, he’s been called a “bright new star” and praised for “sharp, smart jabs on politics, family, and life as a black man” (Portland Mercury).

 Among the cool venues he’s been lucky enough to perform are: The Secret Society, Jackpot Recording Studios, Curious Comedy Theater, and Helium Comedy Club; where he was named Dirty Dozen Roast Battle champion and picked as one of their “New Faces”

He hosts the raucous and unpredictable Midnight Mic every Friday night at Funhouse Lounge and was recently chosen to replace the beloved Nariko Ott (RIP) as of the many co-hosts of the weekly showcase You’re Welcome at the gorgeous stage at Mississippi Pizza.
