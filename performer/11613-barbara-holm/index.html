Portland comedian Barbara Holm has performed at the San Francisco Sketchfest, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, the All Jane Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot Arts festival, Rose City Comic Con, PAX Convention, and the Women in Comedy Festival in Boston. She has written for IGN, The Portland Mercury, and the Huffington Post. 

She has been awarded Time Out New York’s &quot;Joke of the Week,&quot; and was named “one of the best things about comedy” by the Comedy Bureau. Her comedy has been described as clever, unique, idiosyncratic, and exuberant. Seattle City Arts Magazine called her a “comedy wizard” and Seattle Stranger Newspaper described her as an “adorable wunderkind” and she describes herself as “running away from this question to hide under the desk right now.”
