Joel Kim Booster is a Chicago bred, Brooklyn based comedian, writer and playwright. Born in Jeju, South Korea, Joel was adopted at a young age and moved to the southwest suburbs of Chicago. Both homeschooled and evangelical, Joel has read the bible literally dozens of times, but has no idea where the state of Oregon is on a map. As a comedian he has appeared on Conan, Comedy Central’s The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail, Logo’s Comedy Cabaret and truTV’s Comedy Knockout. His writing credits include Billy on the Street and the Comedy Central pilot Problematic with Moshe Kasher. Esquire Magazine recently listed Joel as one of their 10 Comedians to Watch in 2017.
