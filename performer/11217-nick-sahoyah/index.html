Since then he has had the pleasure of performing his act across the country at a bunch of comedy festivals such as Limestone , Bridgetown, Hell Yes Fest, Out Of Bounds, and SFSketchfest. In Seattle he serves as the regular cohost of Not Too Late with Elicia Sanchez as well as producing and emceeing Out &amp; In, Seattle&#039;s longest running queer comedy showcase. Outside of stand up you may recognize Nick from Monsoon Season on Funny or Die, his latest short film, Poster Boy!, or his appearance in the feature-length Jinkx Monsoon documentary Drag Becomes Him.
