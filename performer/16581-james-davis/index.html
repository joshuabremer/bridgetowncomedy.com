James Davis is a rising force in comedy. Comedy Central has just given a series order to Davis' primetime TV show, The James Davis Show where Davis will explore contemporary urban topics and share his perspective on the world he grew up in through a unique, hybrid style of comedy that bridges the gap between urban and mainstream comedy. Prior to this, Davis was a recurring character on Kevin Hart’s hit show, Real Husbands of Hollywood, and a round table regular on Chelsea Lately.  James is constantly writing, directing, and producing original content for Funny Or Die and recently finished writing for James Corden’s Late Late Show on CBS. 

You can also catch James hosting his monthly stand-up show, Urban Dictionary, at the Nerdist Showroom at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles, starring in Comedy Central’s Snapchat original series, Swag-a-Saurus, which is Comedy Centrals' most-watched Snapachat show, and performing in Comedy Central's musical number, The Jam.
