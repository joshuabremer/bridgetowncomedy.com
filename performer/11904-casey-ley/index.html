Casey Ley was voted Best Comic in San Francisco in 2012 by the SFWeekly. He has since relocated to Los Angeles and the SFWeekly &quot;will forgive but never forget.&quot; Casey is the creator and co-host of the live touring comedy show &quot;Some People Like Us with Kaseem Bentley&quot; as well as a regular member of The Mission Position, which was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Events in San Francisco&quot; by Time Out World. 

His comedy has been seen in festivals and clubs across the United States, and you can tune in each week to hear him explore world issues with his &quot;uniquely queer lens and erudite wit,&quot; (msn.com) on his podcast &quot;The Gay Power Half an Hour.&quot;
