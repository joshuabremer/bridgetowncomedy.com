Andy Erikson’s love of squirrels and unicorns is only surpassed by her love of performing standup comedy. She intertwines silly one liners with whimsical stories in a playful, but thought provoking way. She was once a semi-finalist for the Andy Kaufman award, has won several comedy competitions, and has performed at many prestigious festivals. In 2015 she made her television debut on NBC’s Last Comic Standing, placing in the top 5. She was also featured on The Guest List: Live From The Barrel House on Seeso. In 2016 she was a guest star on Scream Queens on Fox and played Chanel #7. Her favorite thing about comedy is making friends.
