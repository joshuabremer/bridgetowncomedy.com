Emma Arnold is a comedian, author, and beekeeper. She tours regularly and performed in fifty two different cities in 2016. A fan favorite on the Dana Gould Hour and Doug Loves Movies, she has also appeared on Screenjunkies and once followed a eulogy at the Limestone Comedy Festival, after which, Bobcat Goldthwait told her he’d never seen anyone do what she does. She has taken this as a compliment. Her greatly anticipated book, “Notion Sickness”, will be published in the spring of 2017. When not touring, Emma lives with her six children (yes, six) In Idaho, where she keeps kids and bees with varying degrees of success.
