Andie Main is a Portland based comedian who keeps busy by producing/hosting The Doug Fir Lounge&#039;s summer series The Cool Kids Patio Show, and her politically themed series called Revolution Comedy; which organizes fundraisers for worthy causes like Planned Parenthood, The ACLU, and Black Lives Matter. To date, she has raised over $10,000 for #TheResistance, and although she&#039;s a lifelong punk rocker, she is proud to see these shows selling out.

Festival credits include The Comedy Exposition, Bumbershoot, Seattle Sketchfest, SF Sketchfest, The All Jane Comedy Festival, Portland Pride 2014, Treefort Festival and Cromfest. She&#039;s performed at UCBeast, UCB Chelsea and The Stand Nightclub in NYC, Put Your Hands Together and The Rabbit Hole in LA, and hosts shows at Helium Comedy Club in Portland.

She is a regular feature act for comedians like TJ Miller, Myq Kaplan and James Adomian, and after her set they&#039;ve all said &quot;hey Andie that was great!&quot; and got brunch because you can order brunch whenever you want in Portland.

In her spare time, she enjoys taking hikes with her not-so-smart dog, punk and post punk music, making goofy paintings, nature documentaries and yelling about the patriarchy.
