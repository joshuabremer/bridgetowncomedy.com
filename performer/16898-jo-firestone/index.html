Jo Firestone was selected as one 2016’s New Faces at JFL, and is becoming a staple at comedy festivals around the United States for her unique, left of center voice.  She is the co-creator and star of the popular RIOT digital series, WOMANHOOD.  She is also the creator and producer of 16 active live comedy shows in New York, including FRIENDS OF SINGLE PEOPLE, which is being developed for television.  She and her father host the long-running NY show PUNDERDOME 3000, which was recently made into a card game published by Random House.  It is currently the #1 bestselling card game Amazon.

 

“The most distinctive experimentalist in New York right now is Jo Firestone, who brings a radiant, big-hearted spirit to deeply committed stunts like hosting an Inner Beauty Pageant.”

– The New York Times
