Joe Pera is a 25 year-old standup comedian currently living and performing in New York City. Growing up in Buffalo, NY, Joe would oftentimes gaze at Canada from across Lake Erie and wonder what it&#039;d be like to perform in the British Commonwealth.

He performs at a wide variety of stages across New York City including numerous alternative venues (UCB Theater and subway platforms) as well as clubs (Caroline&#039;s, Gotham, The Stand) and even the MoMA PS1 Theater. Last fall, he was named as one of Comedy Central&#039;s &#039;Comics To Watch&#039;.

In addition to live comedy, Joe has written and acted in online series made for MTVOther and Adultswim.com.

Every year, he submits to the Andy Kaufman Award but has yet to be accepted.

Pera’s web series THE PERFECT WEEK premiered on JASH, spring 2014. Additionally, Pera has appeared on the ADAM DEVINE’S HOUSE PARTY (Comedy Central).
