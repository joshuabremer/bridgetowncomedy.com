With the sweetness of the Midwest and the iron balls of the East Coast, Jenny Zigrino is a comedian that packs a punch of truly original humor. She&#039;s charmed audiences across the country with her wit, keen observations, embarrassing anecdotes, and brilliant honesty for a compelling performance you can&#039;t ignore.  

She made her late night debut on Conan O&#039;Brien in May of 2015 and was a Comedy Central Comic to Watch of 2013. Since then, she&#039;s starred in then new Marlon Wayan&#039;s film &quot;50 Shades of Black&quot; and can be seen in the highly anticipated movie &quot;Bad Santa 2&quot; in November.  Her TV credits include Adam Divine&#039;s House Party, @Midnight, TBS, Oxygen, and Fox.

She&#039;s a regular performer at the Women in Comedy Festival and has also performed at the New York Comedy Festival, RIOTLA Comedy Festival, The 9s Music Festival, Great American Comedy Festival, Cape Fear Comedy Festival, Boston Comedy Festival, and many others.
