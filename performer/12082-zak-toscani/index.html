Zak is a stand-up comedian who lives in Portland, OR. He has performed at the Bumbershoot Music &amp; Arts Festival and the Bridgetown Comedy Festival. You may have also seen him perform at Helium Comedy Club, Go Bananas, the Tacoma Comedy Club, and Seattle&#039;s Comedy Underground as well as other stages both intimate and large.

His style melts like an artisan cheese into both the honest and the silly, much like Dom DeLuise&#039;s lasagna recipe.
