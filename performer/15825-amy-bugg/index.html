Amy Bugg knows good gravy. Dipping into snippets of her life growing up with mischievous brothers, a concerned mother and an idiosyncratic father, Amy treats audiences to a rich smothering of autobiographical laugh sauce. Her soft-spoken delivery will gently spoon happiness into your ears and leave you patting your tummies with mirthful satisfaction. Wear your stretchy pants and get ready for a belly full of delicious laughs!

Amy has performed on Sled Island, CBC’s “Grown-ups Read Things They Wrote as Kids”, and Sirius Xm’s Top Comic. She was also featured in Canadian Living’s  “A Year of Firsts.”
