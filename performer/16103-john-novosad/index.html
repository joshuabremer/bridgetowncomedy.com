My name is John Novosad. I am from Boulder, Colorado. I am based out of the Comedy Works in Denver, Colorado. I am a stand-up comic. I tour nationally. I was married for eleven years. I am divorced. We did not have any children. I’m six feet tall. I weigh one hundred and ninety-three pounds. I first did stand-up in 1980. I toured extensively between 1985 and 1993. I worked a day job and did comedy part-time from 1994 through 2001. I have been a full-time comic since 2002. Performing stand-up is great fun. It drives me to open mics on my nights off.
