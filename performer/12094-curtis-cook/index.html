Curtis Cook is a comic from Ohio now living in Portland, Oregon. He&#039;s been featured on VICELAND&#039;s televised comedy series, Flophouse and performed in venues and festivals throughout the country, including the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, the Chicago Comedy Exposition, and San Francisco’s Sketchfest.

The Portland Mercury described Curtis’ comedy as “sleepy, slam poetry,” and the Willamette Week highlighted him as among Portland’s funniest comics.

In addition to performing stand-up, Curtis has also appeared on DAILY VICE and television programs in Kenya, Sierra Leone, and throughout the Middle East. He also co-hosts Earthquake Hurricane, a superlative comedy show every Wednesday night in PDX.
