Derek Gaines was born in California, but found his comedy chops while growing up in Philadelphia. He currently calls New York City his home, where he regularly performs and brings a unique perspective to growing up African American in the suburbs. 

Derek&#039;s first break came when he reached the semi finals of Bill Bellamy&#039;s &quot;Who&#039;s Got Jokes&quot; in 2010. Also in 2010, Derek was a finalist in Philadelphia&#039;s Funniest Person Competition. Derek made his standup comedy television debut in 2014 when he appeared on AXS TV&#039;s &quot;Gotham Comedy Live,&quot; and was selected by the Just For Laughs Festival as part of their New Faces. He is a contributor to VH1’s &quot;Morning Buzz,&quot; starred in Morgan Spurlock’s docu-series “Connected,&quot; and is currently the co-host of MTV’s &quot;Broke Ass Game Show.&quot;
