In 2010 The Hollywood Reporter named Nick Vatterott one of the “break-outs” at Montreal’s Just for Laughs Comedy Festival. Since then he has performed on Conan, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and has a half hour special on Comedy Central. Nick was also a producer/writer/performer on Comedy Central’s stand-up sketch hybrid show Mash-Up, and with co-creator TJ Miller sold the project Manimation to Fox's ADHD. He was the recipient of the prestigious Andy Kaufman award in 2011 and before heading off to NYC, Chicago Magazine listed Nick as “The Funniest Man in Chicago.” Nick’s debut comedy record, FOR AMUSMENT ONLY was released in November 2014 by Comedy Central Records and was voted by Vulture, Laughspin, and Splitsider as one of the year’s best comedy albums. In addition to naming Vatterott’s album one of the best of 2014, Vulture.com also listed him as one of the top 50 comedians you should know in 2015. Nick has been called “one of the most dynamic performer’s today” by The Laugh Button and his LATE NIGHT WITH JIMMY FALLON set was received as “so damn brilliant” by The Chicago Reader.  Nick has also had correspondent work on THE BIG TEN NETWORK and is currently writing for GORBURGER on Comedy Central with TJ Miller.
