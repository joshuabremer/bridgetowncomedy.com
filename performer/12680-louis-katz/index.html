Louis Katz’s comedy deftly combines the highbrow and the lowbrow, creating a style that is truly unique.

An internationally headlining comedian, Louis&#039; numerous television appearances include NBC’s “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,” HBO’s “Down &amp; Dirty w/Jim Norton,” and most recently, Comedy Central’s “Comedy Underground w/Dave Attell.”

He was also a regularly featured writer/correspondent on FX’s “Totally Biased with W Kamau Bell.”

His half-hour “Comedy Central Presents” special aired in 2011, coinciding with the release of his debut comedy album, “If These Balls Could Talk,” on Comedy Central Records.

Louis also produced a series of short films for Adult Swim’s superdeluxe.com, which can now be seen at youtube.com/louiskatzcomedy.

“Katz is funny to the point that Hitler would have given him a sleeper car on the train.” - Doug Stanhope
