Brad Silnutzer is a stand up, writer, producer, and host who was recently named one of Comedy Centralâ€™s 2016 Comics to Watch.  Brad created, produces, and hosts Brew HaHa: The Comedy Show Drinking game. He has written for shows such as Penn and Teller&quot; Fool Us for CW, Talent Overload for Verizon Go90, and The Hook Up for MTV.

As a young lad, Brad started his performing career as the Ovaltine boy saying such lines as, &quot;More Ovaltine Please&quot; and &quot;Mom, why are you making me do this?&quot;.  Now, he can be found wandering the streets on LA wondering why he left two promising careers to start doing comedy.
