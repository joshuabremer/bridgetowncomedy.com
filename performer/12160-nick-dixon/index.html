Nick Dixon’s acerbic wit and intelligent, edgy writing have led to him becoming a finalist in the prestigious ‘So You Think You’re Funny?’ competition,  being selected from over 800 applicants to feature in the BBC New Comedy Awards, and winning the infamous King Gong show at The Comedy Store.

Nick recently appeared on the Comedy Central series ‘Comedy Central at the Comedy Store,’ and will also be in the new season shooting March 2016.

He featured in a National TV ad for GoCompare (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aUGuMw1Ywo) and has written topical jokes for the BBC Radio 4 show ‘Newsjack.’

He regularly performs at all the top clubs throughout the UK such as The Comedy Store, The Stand, Glee, etc.

In LA this year he performed at The Ice House, and on shows like French Toast and Sleepaway Camp, which he headlined.

Chortle, the UK’s main comedy website said:

&#039;Nick Dixon has a sparky cynicism that engages while maintaining an edge to his well-crafted jokes, delivered with certainty, earmarking him as a future success.&#039;
