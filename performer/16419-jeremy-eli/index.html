Originally from upstate New York, Jeremy Eli began performing comedy while in college. Attending open mics in New York City whenever possible. In 2013 he moved to Portland. His unique perspectives, quick wit, and sly word play made him a rising talent in the scene. He can regularly be seen hosting at Helium comedy club and heard on his irreverent podcast Eat Food, Already.

Moving to Portland has given Jeremy many opportunities and he contributes heavily to the Portland comedy community. Jeremy hosts the weekly Lights Out Open Mic. In 2014 he began producing and hosting the popular and well regraded Minority Retort, a recurring comedy event that showcases Comedians of Color in the Pacific Northwest.

He’s a rising star in Portland with an outspoken and unique comic presence, so please, keep it going for Jeremy Eli.
