Originally from Chicago, Tony is probably the only comedian who can say he was published in Nature Medicine (Oooooh.)

Since turning in his lab coat, he’s written and produced on several shows including MTV’s Ridiculousness, A&amp;E’s show Brandi and Jarrod: Married to the Job, CNBC’s Jay Leno’s Garage, A&amp;E’s Storage Wars: Barry Strikes Back, and Food: Fact or Fiction with Michael McKean. He’s also written for Funny or Die, MTV2’s Guy Code Online, MTV News, Playboy, SMOSH, and regrettably, TMZ. This spring he’ll be appearing on the 3rd season of TRU TV’s Hack My Life.

Check out his debut comedy album, Scaredy Cat, produced by Stand Up! Records, which was heralded by the Huffington Post.
