Joe Tullar is a comic, writer, and just a normal guy living in Austin, TX. He performs at Cap City Comedy Club and is a two-time finalist in the Funniest Person in Austin Competition. Also, he isn&#039;t funny. Psych! He IS pretty dang funny. In fact, his stand-up act tackles a range of topics from butterflies to wolves.
