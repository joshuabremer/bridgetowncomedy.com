John B. Duff is a Winnipeg stand-up comic and the 2005 winner of Winnipeg’s Funniest Person with a Day Job competition. He placed in the top 10 of CTV’s Nationwide Corner Gas Comic Genius competition and was a local finalist in the Just for Laughs National Homegrown Comic Competition in 2007.

10 years after naming the Bridgetown Comedy Festival (no joke!) and near continuous hilarity John has moved on to co-found the successful Oddblock Comedy Festival in Winnipeg, Canada.
