Kara Klenk is a stand up comic, writer, and actor who grew up in Connecticut, the no-one-proclaimed comedy capital of New England. She was recently named by Time Out New York as one of the Top 10 Funniest Women in NYC and the overwhelming fame that followed drove her to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.

Kara has appeared on several cable channels and websites and has written for Nickelodeon, MTV, TVLand, and Comedy Central. She also produces/hosts a long-running stand up show,  If You Build It, at the Upright Citizen's Brigade Theater in NYC and LA. 

It took her 2 weeks to learn Snapchat but she's got it now.
