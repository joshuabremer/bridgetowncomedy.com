Julia is a comedian and writer based in New York City, by way of Boston. Pedaling her sharp, almost always self-deprecating jokes, she quickly became a staple in the Boston comedy scene, performing at bar shows, clubs and colleges all over the East Coast and beyond. She has performed in the Boston Comedy Festival, the Limestone Comedy Festival, the Brooklyn Comedy Festival and the New York Comedy Festival, and has opened for Aparna Nancherla, Beth Stelling, Mark Normand, Charlie Pickering, Carmen Lynch, and SNL&#039;s Aidy Bryant. Since moving to New York she has performed in venues all over the city including UCB and Night Train at Littlefield. She has been featured on NPR&#039;s You&#039;re the Expert and Nerdist&#039;s Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction.
