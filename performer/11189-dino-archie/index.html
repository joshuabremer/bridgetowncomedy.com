I&#039;m not doing that 3rd person tense as if someone else wrote this.  I started out writing and acting but I always wanted to be funny. I love stand up.  I like to make it feel like we&#039;re in a bar or living room where you can talk shit about anything and make it funny.  I split my time between Vancouver and LA.  Most recently, I won 1st place in the 2015 Seattle International Comedy Competition. In 2016, I made my standup television debut on Comedy Central’s “Adam Devine’s House Party.”  I have opened up for Hannibal Buress, Reggie Watts and toured with Chris D&#039;elia on the “Under No Influence Tour.”  

My debut CD  “Choosy Lover” is available to stream at www.dinoarchie.com
