Comedian Karen Kilgariff worked as an actor on HBO's legendary sketch program Mr. Show and as the head writer for Ellen DeGeneres. But she's found a niche for herself as the composer of scathingly-funny songs about smart-phone obsession, drinking on holidays and dysfunctional relationships and as the co-host of the smash hit podcast My Favorite Murder.
