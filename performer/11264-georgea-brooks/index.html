Georgea Brooks is a stand up comic, originally from Toronto, Canada. In 2010 she was nominated for The Second City&#039;s Cream of Comedy, which celebrates breakout out Canadian comedians. Georgea was also the co-host of the TV show Late Night with Matty D. She has been on stand up tours through both American and Canadian colleges. Georgea currently produces the stand up shows Strip Comedy and the charity fundraiser Sheltered Comedy. She is also writing and acting on a web series about motherhood, where she plays a boy crazy nanny, which for the record is not a stretch. Other than that someone once described her body type as “thick”; so I guess she&#039;s got that going for her.
