George Civeris is a Boston-based writer and comedian who performs all over New England and New York. Most recently, he won MoveOn.org&#039;s nationwide &quot;Laughter Trumps Hate&quot; contest, which was judged by a panel that included Judd Apatow, Adam McKay, and Baratunde Thurston (http://www.laughtertrumpshate.com/winners). Last year, he performed at the Boston Comedy Festival, and in March 2017 he will be the comic-in-residence at Boston&#039;s famous Comedy Studio. He co-produces an award-winning weekly alternative comedy showcase called The Mendoza Line. As a gay immigrant, George is feeling pretty chill about the future.
