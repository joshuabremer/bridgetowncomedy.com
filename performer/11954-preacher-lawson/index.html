One of the most likeable, animated characters you&#039;ll ever see perform, Preacher Lawson has been bringing his brand of goofy, high-energy comedy to the stage since he was seventeen. 

Young or old, man or woman, black or white -- Preacher&#039;s clean, energetic style will keep you on your toes and, more importantly, laughing.

Preacher has performed with a long list of great comedians including Loni Love, and was a semi-finalist in Comedy Central&#039;s &quot;Up Next&quot; and winner of 2015 Florida&#039;s Funniest Comedian Competition.
