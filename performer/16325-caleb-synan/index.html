Caleb Synan

So far in 2015, Caleb Synan has made appearances on CONAN, NBC’s Last Comic Standing, and the Bob and Tom Show. His deceptively smart blend of Southern charm and razor sharp wit has also made him a festival favorite, with appearances at Montreal’s Just For Laughs, Laugh Your Asheville Off, The Charleston Comedy Festival, and Athfest 2015. He also won “Wittiest” in Franklin County High School’s 2009 Yearbook. And he’s a pretty nice guy.
