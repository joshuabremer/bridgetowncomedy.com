Onstage Geoffrey likes talking about his adult bed-wetting and that one first date where he went bird-watching. Most people say he’s got a cute butt and you should too! Other people say he’s a little ‘quirky’ and should stop stroking their hair.

Geoffrey’s self-aware sense of humor has been heard all over the Midwest through appearances in the Limestone, Green Gravel, Milwaukee, Madison, and Cleveland comedy festivals. Geoffrey won Comedy on State’s “Funniest Person in Madison 2015” and Penguins Comedy Club’s “Funniest Person in Iowa 2015” and was also a finalist for the 2014 Cleveland Comedy Festival. He has opened for Brian Posehn, Todd Barry, Mark Norman and Cameron Esposito and regularly performs at the Comedy Club on State in Madison, Wisconsin. 

When Geoffrey opened for Ryan Stout, a COOL dude, Ryan told Geoffrey to ‘tone it down a bit.’

Will do!
