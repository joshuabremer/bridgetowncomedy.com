Yusef Roach is a serious boy. He started performing comedy in Austin in January 2013 and has since taken nothing by storm. He can occasionally be seen in Austin at The Velveeta Room, The New Movement Theater or Cap City Comedy Club. He has performed on the 2014 and 2015 Hell Yes Fest (NOLA), and 2014&#039;s SLC Comedy Carnivale (UT). His comedy is best described as “Yea, ok, sure. I guess, maybe. Fine.”
