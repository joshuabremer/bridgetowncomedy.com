Janeane has had many memorable and critically acclaimed roles in film and television since bursting on the scene in 1992. She's appeared in films such as "The Truth About Cats and Dogs," "Wet Hot American Summer," "Ratatouille" and "Reality Bites."

She was instrumental in the successful launching of the first liberal radio network, Air America Radio, where she hosted her own talk show, "The Majority Report." A lightning rod for controversy, Janeane's well-informed opinions and unflinching honesty have inspired laughs as well as striking a chord with the left, right and everyone in between. She is a noted peace activist.
