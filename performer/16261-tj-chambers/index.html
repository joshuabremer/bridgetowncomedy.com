A 10-year veteran of the Great Stand Up Wars, T.J. Chambers escaped largely unharmed and was later awarded the lauded Presidential Drink Ticket of Freedom. He now whiles away his days as a barely sought-after comedy writer in both his home port of Los Angeles and abroad. Some of his many credits include Betty White&#039;s Off Their Rockers (starring old people!) and Dancing With The Stars (watched by old people!). A few groups of letters that have seen fit to trade him money for jokes are NBC, Fox, MTV, ITV, USA, Syfy, and Channel 4. That one has a number in it! T.J. is proud to return to Bridgetown.
