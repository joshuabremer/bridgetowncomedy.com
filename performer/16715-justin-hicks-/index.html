Justin Hicks is a stand up comedian based in Austin, TX.  Justin was raised in small town Connecticut and has lived in Texas since 2010.  Much of his comedy is drawn from his upbringing and southern experiences.  He has a calm demeanor and cool delivery that is unique and easy to connect with.  Justin&#039;s humor covers topics ranging from chap-stick to R&amp;B music (he may or may not be the best R&amp;B comic in central Texas).  Justin began performing comedy in 2015.  He was a semi-finalist in the 2016 Funniest Person in Austin competition and has preformed at the Crossroads Comedy Festival (Indianapolis, IN)  and MR Fest (San Marcos, TX).
