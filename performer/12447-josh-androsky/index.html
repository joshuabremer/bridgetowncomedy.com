Josh Androsky quit high school early to pursue his love of television. By 20, he was a full time writer. When he was like 22 he wrote/produced FOX’s New Year’s Eve Live. Weird, right? Scott Weiland was there and it went about the way you’d assume. At 23, Josh started doing stand-up comedy and has since performed at festivals and venues across the nation, appeared on This American Life, SyFy’s Sharkmania, and contributes to VICE among other corporately-owned counterculture outlets, including several appearances on VICELAND’s upcoming stand-up house party series “Flophouse,” produced by Lance Bangs and Spike Jonze– oh and one time he ate shrooms and got weird as The Skateboard Rabbi on The Price is Right. Throughout it all, his love of writing for television has only intensified. He has written for truTV’s “Billy on the Street,” Nickelodeon’s “SpongeBob SquarePants,” and most recently partnered with Comedy Central to fuck with Donald Trump. So yes, at the end of the day, his cat and girlfriend could not be happier for him.
