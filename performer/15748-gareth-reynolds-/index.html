GARETH REYNOLDS hails from the sweet streets of Milwaukee, Wisconsin originally. After moving to Los Angeles, Gareth starred in NBC’s ‘The Real Wedding Crashers’ which was as creatively stimulating as it was successful. However, through that show he began producing and writing their own material, eventually making shows at COMEDY CENTRAL, the TRAVEL CHANNEL, and MTV.

In 2015 he began doing an American History podcast called ‘The Dollop’ with Dave Anthony which currently gets over 1.3 million downloads each month. The podcast has taken him all over the world to perform it. He just appeared in the ABC show ‘Hail Mary’ in which he is one of the leads and is a writer on NETFLIX original series Flaked. He currently has a development deal with FOX and he now tours the country doing stand up. He also has a cat named Jose.
