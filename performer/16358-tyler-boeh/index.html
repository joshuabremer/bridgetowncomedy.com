Who goes from being a mild-mannered nationally recognized vocal percussionist in his college Acapella group to becoming a high-energy, intelligent, physical, beat-boxing and downright silly comedian with a comedy CD chosen by Under the Gun Review as the best Comedy Album of 2012?  None other than Comedian Tyler Boeh, who shifted his emphasis from singing acapella (a word he describes as Latin for “Without Girlfriend”) when he won a comedy contest in his home town of Portland Oregon.  After winning and placing in the finals of numerous Comedy Competitions from San Francisco to Portland to Seattle to Boston to The World Series of Comedy, Tyler not only launched a great career in comedy which has included television appearances, colleges, cruise ships and headlining clubs all across the county, he also found a girlfriend.

Now well established in the comedy scene (and finding a girlfriend that has since become his wife)  you may have seen Tyler on such shows as FOX’s Laughs, Craig Fergusson’s Celebrity Name Game, Moms Rule, NESN’s Comedy All Stars, or  heard him on Sirius XM Radio, Pandora, iTunes, heard his album “Carpool Companion”  or heard about one of the two television pilots he recently completed, but don’t miss a chance to see Tyler Boeh live.
