Abby Rosenquist is a stand up comedian who has been described as quick-witted and sometimes dark. Her fast-paced material comes from her experiences playing rugby, studying engineering, family, relationships, and life in general. Abby transplanted from Omaha, Nebraska to Austin last year and has since been featured at Montreal&#039;s Just For Laughs Festival, Moontower Comedy Festival and at the Big Sky Comedy Festival.
