Jason Goad wanted a job working the fewest hours in the day, the fewest days of the week, and didn’t require getting up early. Jason found comedy later in life after attempts at being a novelist, short-story writer, and slam poet. He has squandered multiple thousands of dot com stock-option dollars and quit a career in the culinary arts twice.

Comedy is the only thing Jason hasn’t had an overwhelming desire to quit. Described as “the Scared Straight of Seattle comedy,” or “if a Lou Reed song was funny,” Jason’s comedy comes from society’s grimy corners. Making frank jokes about terrible things, Jason has been featured at the Redwood Comedy Festival, the Bumbershoot Music and Arts Festival, the 36th Annual Seattle International Comedy Competition, and has written jokes for Brian Posehn.

Jason lives in Seattle, Washington.
