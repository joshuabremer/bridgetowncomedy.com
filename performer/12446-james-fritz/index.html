Originally from Kentucky, James Fritz is a comedian who is strong as moonshine yet soothing as a Sunday morning. After ruining his credit score in Chicago, he made his way to sunny Los Angeles to kinda tolerate the West Coast lifestyle. He has an album coming out on A Special Thing records this fall.
