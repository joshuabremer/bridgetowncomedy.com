Dan Weber grew up in a town where the high school mascot was the Cheesemakers, which is funny until you realize it’s actually grimly prophetic.

Dan has been many things, married, homeless, divorced, and dead for 15 minutes.

He still is some of them.

Dan talks on stage about all the topics you are supposed to never discuss in polite company.  From religion to politics to life experience over-sharing, he leaves no sacred cow untipped.

Dan also has a podcast and live show, Reading The Bible With Dan, where he reads and mocks America’s most revered book.

Dan runs a writing workshop named Comedy Write Now, a crowdwork/improv show named Crowd Control and (with Wednesday Weiss) the world’s most brutal game show Who’s Metal As Fuck.

Dan has performed at the Idaho Laugh Fest, Mutiny Radio Comedy Festival, Seattle Comedy Underground, Punchline Comedy @ Jai Thai and nearly every showcase in Portland Oregon and surrounding areas.

He also likes roleplaying games but please keep that to yourself.
