Hampton is a comedian and is also a human being filled with blood and guts. He started comedy in DC and later moved to LA where he’s currently working as a writer and performer. Please hire him (me, it’s always been me)

He’s written and produced for: Ridiculousness on MTV, The Eric Andre Show, Loiter Squad, The Meltdown, and Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Hampton has performed his stand up on Conan, Comedy Central, MTV, and for multiple festivals, including: Just For Laughs, SXSW, FYF, Bridgetown Comedy Festival, Oddball Comedy Fest, New York Comedy Festival, Comedy Central South Beach Festival

Currently he is the voice of Crow T. Robot on Mystery Science Theater 3000 coming soon to Netflix. He has a new album out called "Bearable" that is his follow up to "Unbearable" and Joss Whedon called it “very funny” right before quitting twitter. His new hour of material is hella tight.
