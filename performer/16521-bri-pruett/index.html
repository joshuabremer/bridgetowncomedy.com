This Portland original just wrapped a run of her comedic solo show Stellar, which the Willamette Week called &quot;Body-positive, pro-self-love, and pro-female sexuality...&quot;

In addition to clubs and festivals, she&#039;s brought her sparkle to Doug Loves Movies, NPR&#039;s Live Wire!, and Comedy Central&#039;s Roast Battle.

Someone once described her as a female Jack Black, she took it as a compliment.
