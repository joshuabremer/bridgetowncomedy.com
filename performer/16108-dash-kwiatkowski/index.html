Dash Kwiatkowski is a chubby nerd. He&#039;s into comic books and jokes.

He is currently the longest reigning Intercontinental Comedy Champion.

Dash features at The Comedy Attic, Comedy on State, Dr. Grins, The Seattle Comedy Underground, and he is a regular at the SF Punch Line, The Sacramento Punch Line, and Cobbs comedy club. He&#039;s been featured in Sketchfest, Limestone, Laugh Your Asheville Off, Crom Omaha, and The Arch City Comedy Festival, as well as SF Comedy Day and the SF International Competition.
