Jesse Elias is a comedian grown in San Francisco and shipped to Los Angeles. He draws inspiration from music and literature of the 19th century and cartoons and candy of the 1990s. Over the years he has performed in Montreal Just for Laughs, Bridgetown, Outside Lands, LA Riot, and SF Sketchfest. He was named one of the best new comics in LA by Splitsider.com. He has appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Viceland&#039;s Flophouse, and written for The Eric Andre Show. Jesse learned everything he knows about being funny by studying the ancient comedies of Plautus and Terrence.
