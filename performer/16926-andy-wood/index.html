In addition to performing standup comedy for the last dozen or so years, Andy Wood has written for, produced or appeared on shows including Science Channel's How To Build Everything, IFC's Portlandia, YouTube Red's Mind Field, TruTV's You Can Do Better, E!'s Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings, Ridiculousness, and The MTV Movie Awards. He also produced and acted in Jason Nash Is Married, the first feature released by Comedy Central’s CC: Studios. Andy's the director and co-founder of the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and along with Matt Kirshen he's co-hosted the weekly podcast Probably Science since 2012, thereby tricking his parents into believing he hasn't wasted his engineering degree. And tricking Neil deGrasse Tyson into coming over to his apartment to appear on the show just last month. He's also obsessed with bar trivia, and if you ask him to join your pub quiz team he is honor-bound to accept.
