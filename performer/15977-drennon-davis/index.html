From his elaborate characters and sketches, to his provocative songs and animation, Drennon has made a name for himself as one of the most innovative minds in today’s comedy scene. His live performances of the Imaginary Radio Program combine live music and beat-boxing with one-man sketches into a show that the Los Angeles Comedy Bureau writes "not only lives up to its name, but exceeds expectation in what you could possibly think it is."

Drennon recently appeared on TBS’s Conan, and has previously appeared on Comedy Central's Adam Devine's House Party, NBC's Last Call and was a semifinalist on Last Comic Standing.  His animated show The Long Legs can be seen on MTV's New Liquid Television. Drennon also provided the theme song to Seeso’s The Show Show, which also features Drennon’s Imaginary Radio Program live show.

He was featured in LA Weekly's Top 10 Comedy Acts to Watch in 2014 and 2015 Best Comedy Duo (with Karen Kilgariff), as well as Splitsider's Top 10 Up &amp; Coming Acts in LA in 2015. Drennon is a recurring presence at comedy festivals all over the world including the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, SXSW, Riot LA Alternative Comedy Festival, San Francisco’s Sketchfest, Vancouver Comedy Festival, the Oddball Comedy Festival and many more!
