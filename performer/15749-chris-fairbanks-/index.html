CHRIS FAIRBANKS is the co-host of ALMOST GENIUS on truTV. 

 

Originally from Montana, Chris headlines comedy venues nationally. His fast paced, quirky and constantly improvised act has been showcased on Comedy Central, Conan, Last Comic Standing, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Vh1 and TruTV. Chris has appeared in the film “Still Punching the Clown', on Comedy Central's @midnight, on Seeso (NBC’s new comedy streaming platform), and on the road opening for Daniel Tosh. 

Chris’ first comedy album, “Fairbanks!” was named one of Amazon and Amazon MP3’s Top Ten of 2010. He also hosts the popular podcast, “Do You Need a Ride”, with Karen Kilgariff on All Things Comedy. They shuttle their guests to or from the airport, somewhat dangerously, in a '08 Honda Accord mobile sound studio. 

 

Chris is also self-employed as a freelance artist, illustrating for magazines, skateboards, and educational textbooks.
