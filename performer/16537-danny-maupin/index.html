Danny Maupin is a dynamic comedian known for using not just his voice, but his whole body to deliver energetic performances that blend unapologetic self-awareness with sharp-witted storytelling. His unique and spontaneous standup has been featured at Comedy Central’s New York Comedy Festival, Chicago Comedy Exposition, Hell Yes Fest, Orlando Indie Comedy Fest, Crom Comedy Festival and many more. 

Danny is based out of Chicago and when he isn’t traveling the country performing standup comedy, he stays busy as co-creator and co-host of Late Late Breakfast which tours extensively as well as maintains monthly shows at The Hideout in Chicago and the legendary The Creek and The Cave in NYC. Late Late Breakfast has been described as “a raucous afternoon of high-energy mischief” by the Chicago Tribune, “a standup comedy show like no other” by The Daily Dot and was recently featured as a top concept comedy show by The Interrobang. He is also a co-producer of Character Assassination at The Laugh Factory in Chicago.
