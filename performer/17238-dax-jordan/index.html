This photo has 3 outdated treasures: a wedding ring, a bunch of hair and a landline telephone. What persists is the connection with NW audiences that fed Dax for the first 12 years of his glorious comedy upbringing. Over the last 9 years of Bridgetown appearances, this now-tanned LA resident has seen his hometown festival grow and give birth to a splendid new generation of performers and comedy-educated audiences. Dax does not like olives and if any of the backstage pizzas so much as TOUCH an olive he will absolutely tank that show and maybe ruin the whole festival, so cool it with them shits. 

 

 

Buy his album "#1 Grandson" on Amazon.
