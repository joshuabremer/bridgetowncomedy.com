A former engineer, Toby left technology to do standup full-time and has gone on to perform in 17 countries, from South Africa to Israel to China. He&#039;s performed at the Hong Kong Comedy Festival and Edinburgh Fringe Festival and opened for comedians Doug Stanhope, Tig Notaro, and Des Bishop.

He&#039;s a host and producer of the Unsafe Space podcast, where comedians do standup on controversial topics, followed by a response from experts and a discussion with the audience. His standup often covers social and political issues while balancing views from different sides of the political spectrum. 

As a writer, he has contributed to shows including HBO&#039;s Real Time with Bill Maher, CMT&#039;s Ron White&#039;s Comedy Salute to the Troops and Yahoo&#039;s Primetime in No Time. He&#039;s currently a staff writer on Top Story! Weekly at Improv Olympic in Los Angeles.
