Born in Tacoma, WA, and raised on U.S. Army bases on the East Coast and in Germany, Adam Pasi is a Portland comic who varies between storytelling and voicing opinions on the world around him that he admits tend to end in a trivial call to arms.  Adam has performed on the Bridgetown, Limestone, and Wenatchee Comedy festivals, and is also a three-time finalist in Portland&#039;s Funniest Person contest. Frequently intense, but never taking himself too seriously, Adam encourages all who will listen to join him in his mostly imaginary, but usually amusing crusade against...well, he&#039;s not sure.  He just knows that loud and silly is the only way to fight it.
