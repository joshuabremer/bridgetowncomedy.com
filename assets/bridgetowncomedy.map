I quickly learned that my comedy wasn’t for everybody, it was for everybody else. The Improv in New York City was my first home. There, being funny onstage was important, but even more so was being funny at the bar with the other comics. In the early days, some of the comedians had a standing bet on how long I’d last on stage. No one guessed it would be thirty-three years. </p>\\n<p>My earliest credit was being musical director for Robin Williams, which worked until people realized that he was not a musician. Around that time, the movie House Of Games was released, written by David Mamet, based on a story by the two of us. A few years later, I played a sleazy comedian in his movie, Things Change – a stretch? </p>\\n<p>I made my debut on Late Night with David Letterman in 1985 and have returned eight times since. I always pretend to leave something behind. </p>\\n<p>Soon, I did The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson – twice, Leno twice, and Conan seven times, but the work that really attracted attention was an animated series I created with Tom Snyder for Comedy Central called Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist. I played the title role and won an Emmy. The show won a Peabody Award. And then Hollywood took an interest: first NBC, then Dreamworks, followed by Paramount where I created a show called Raising Dad, which aired on the WB network. </p>\\n<p>I’ve had roles in many animated shows, including Home Movies, Bob’s Burgers, Adventure Time and Explosion Bus, but probably more people have seen me as the social worker in Eddie Murphy’s film Daddy Day Care than in any other role. </p>\\n<p>Currently I am working on a book with David Mamet called the The Home for Unfortunate Animals and happen to be living in one, too. </p>\\n<p>You can hear me on my podcast Hey, We’re Back on WKATZ.com.</p>\\n\", PhotoUrl:\"http://bridgetown.festivalthing.com/sites/default/files/images/performers/dr_katz_live.jpg\", PerformerId:\"10349\", Twitter:\"jonathan_katz\", Website:\"http://www.jonathankatz.com/\", Position:\"1\", id:\"10349\", pageUrl:\"10349-jonathan-katz\", ExcludeFromList:false, SortOrder:1, events:[\"10426\", \"10428\"], mc_events:[\"10403\"]}, {Name:\"Andy Kindler\", Bio:\"<p>Andy Kindler is known in comedy circles as a troublemaker.

In eliminating one of the essential elements of traditional live comedy, Seven Mintues In Purgatory amplifies the comics&#039; neuroses, giving fans a different perspective on their favorite performers. The live-streamed element gives performers the chance to experiment within these newfound conceptual constraints.

The show has been featured in The A.V. Club, Chicago Tribune, and the Chicago Reader, and has sold out every Chicago show to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven Minutes in Purgatory was created by Ian Abramson, who was recently named Chicago&#039;s best Experimental Comedian by Chicago Magazine and has been described as &quot;one of the smartest, weirdest and funniest guys on the scene&quot; by the Chicago Tribune, and Matt Byrne, a Chicago-based comedy producer who recently co-founded the Comedy Exposition, a stand-up comedy festival in Chicago.

Someone  picks a random TV Guide, writes down everything in it that they want to watch in prime time (8-10pm) and then the podcast is the discussion of their choices. Ken does occasionally break format for the celebrity editions, where the TV Guide is used as an inspiration to discuss their careers.\\r\\n\\r\\n60  episodes are out so far (and a lot more banked) and they have been getting a really great response (Ken is also having a ton of fun doing them). The conversations kind of get into stories about growing up, people&#039;s relationship with television, some cultural/media studies dissection and Ken spits out a lot of trivia. It&#039;s a fun conversation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt&#039;s up on iTunes if you want to check it out\\r\\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tv-guidance-counselor-podcast/id821665905\\r\\n\\r\\nThere&#039;s more detail and what not also up on the webpage\\r\\nhttp://tvguidancecounselor.com/\\r\\n \\r\\nGuests have included Jim Beaver (Supernatural, Justified, Deadwood) Captain Sensible and Dave Vanian of the Damned, Amy Sedaris, Christian Finnegan, Laura Kightlinger, JoAnn Willete (Just the Ten of Us, Facts of Life), Melanie Chartoff (Fridays, Parker Lewis Can&#039;t Lose, Rugrats), Laraine Newman, Michael Ian Black, Kumail Nanjiani, James Adomian, Jonathan Katz, Andy Kindler, Hari Kondabolu, Alex Edelman, Myq Kaplan, Kelly MacFarland,  Bethany Van Delft, Danny Tamberelli (&quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete), Josh Gondelman, Giulia Rozzi, Adam Resnick (Get a Life, Cabin Boy), Julia Duffy, Vanessa Angel and more\\r\\n\\r\\nHere&#039;s an incredibly nice piece Cinema Blend recently wrote about the show:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.cinemablend.com/television/TV-Guidance-Counselor-Nostalgia-Driven-Comedy-Podcast-You-Need-Listening-66551.html\\r\\n\\r\\nand here&#039;s one from USA Today&#039;s Pop Candy Blog\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2014/07/28/tv-guidance-counselor/13280167/\\r\\n\\r\\nand it got recently featured in the New York Times as well. \\r\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/nyregion/new-york-super-week-offers-cultural-highlights.html?_r=1\\r\\n\\r\\nKen has also done live editions of the show at New York Comic Con, New York Super Week, North East Comic Con, The Boston Comedy Festival and Riot LA. \",\n    Bio: \"This show is a ton of fun and fairly unique. It&#039;s not snarky at all. We show a real reverence for the shows of our youth and peel back life experiences to discuss living situations and the shared experience of classic television. It&#039;s a fun conversation and a nice change from stand up.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other Stand up comedian fronted podcasts, this one doesn&#039;t focus too much on the mechanics of comedy. Although I&#039;ve only been doing the show a year, we&#039;re getting about 10k downloads a month all over the world. I&#039;ve also had some experience with doing live editions as we&#039;ve done them now at New York Super Week/New York ComicCon (with Amy Sedaris), North East Comic Con (with Evan Michaelson from Oddieis/Obscura Antiques), The Boston Comedy Festival (with Emmanuel Lewis of Webster) and will have done one at Riot LA in January (guest TBA, I know who it is, but don&#039;t want to jinx it, nice big name).\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a unique knowledge of television and revisiting a specific week of our lives always leads to some fun tangents and interesting insights from my guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nI own every issue of TV Guide, and review them frequently. It&#039;s a life long passion and it&#039;s interesting to see how people form all different backgrounds share an early love of television. \",\n    PhotoUrl: \"http://bridgetown.festivalthing.com/sites/default/files/images/show-submissions/kentvgc_0.jpg\",\n    SubmittedId: \"9240\",\n    Position: \"27\",\n    \"iTunes Url\": \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tv-guidance-counselor-podcast/id821665905\",\n    id: \"9240\",\n    pageUrl: \"9240-tv-guidance-counselor\",\n    SortOrder: 27,\n    iTunesUrl: \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tv-guidance-counselor-podcast/id821665905\",\n    events: [\"10405\"]\n  }, {\n    Name: \"Comedy and Cocktails\",\n    Copy: \"New Deal Distillery  presents Comedy and Cocktails, a monthly stand-up showcase featuring top comic talent from Portland and beyond.
