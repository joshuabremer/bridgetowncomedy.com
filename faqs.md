Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I buy individual show tickets in advance?**

Yes! Well, sort of. This year we are selling advance individual show tickets to the two shows we’re putting on at Revolution Hall ([Lance Bangs Presents Come Laugh With Us on May 5th](http://www.revolutionhall.com/event/1468352-lance-bangs-come-laugh-us-portland/), [An Evening With The Guys From Mystery Science Theater 3000 on May 6th](http://www.revolutionhall.com/event/1468354-evening-guys-from-mystery-portland/)) as well as [The Goddamn Comedy Jam at Crystal Ballroom on May 4th](http://www.crystalballroompdx.com/events/168154-The-Goddamn-Comedy-Jam).

Apart from those shows, we only sell festival passes in advance. The Standard Festival Pass grants admission to all Bridgetown shows EXCEPT those mentioned above, and the Golden Ticket VIP Pass grants admission to all Bridgetown shows INCLUDING the shows mentioned above. [You can buy both types of passes here while they’re available](https://bridgetown2017.eventbrite.com/)!

If you want to attend any other single shows, you can pay admission as you enter (doors open 30 minutes prior to showtime). This has been Bridgetown’s longtime policy in an attempt to avoid penalizing full festival pass-holders. This way, no matter how popular a single show may be, those with festival passes and those who only want to attend one show have an equal chance at getting in by lining up beforehand.

Note: Individual show tickets are only valid for a single show. They do not grant access for the following shows in the same venue.

**So I bought a festival pass. What now? Where do I pick it up?**

If you bought a Standard Festival Pass or Golden Ticket VIP Pass, you will get a wristband to wear throughout the weekend that grants you admission to shows. To pick up your festival wristband, please bring a printout of your Eventbrite receipt, or show your receipt on your smartphone, or just show a picture ID at any of the [2017 Bridgetown Comedy Festival venues](https://www.bridgetowncomedy.com/venues) (ONLY DURING THE FESTIVAL -- the venues will only have will call for Bridgetown passes set up half an hour before shows begin). This wristband is what grants admission to shows, and must be worn at all times. If you remove or lose your wristband, you will need to purchase a new one.

**Are tickets transferable?**

No. Your weekend wristband is meant to be worn by you and only you throughout the weekend. If you wish to transfer your ticket into someone else’s name before the festival, you may request to do so by emailing [info@bridgetowncomedy.com](mailto:info@bridgetowncomedy.com)

**Are all shows 21 and over?**

All of the shows in this year's festival are 21 and over. If at any point we add shows to the schedule that are all-ages we’ll be sure to mark them clearly.

**What does my Golden Ticket VIP Pass get me?**

Your VIP Golden Ticket Pass grants you front-of-the-line access to shows, a free Bridgetown T-shirt, admission to the May 5th and 6th shows at Revolution Hall as well as Goddamn Comedy Jam at Crystal Ballroom on May 4th, and admission to the pre-festival meet-and-greet on the afternoon of Thursday, May 4th. If you purchased a Golden Ticket, you will receive an email a week before the festival with information on the meet-and-greet via the email address you used when purchasing your pass.

**Do certain shows forbid late admittance?**

It is a good idea to get to shows early to ensure entry. Once a show has sold out, you will not be able to enter. There may be certain cases that require waiting until a natural break in the performance before late entry is allowed.

**Where can I see a schedule of all the shows in the festival?**

[Here's the schedule of shows](https://www.bridgetowncomedy.com/schedule). Note that this schedule and the performer lineup is subject to change. A printed version of the schedule in grid form will also be available during the festival.

**What venues is the festival using this year?**
