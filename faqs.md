Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I buy individual show tickets in advance?**

Yes! Well, sort of. This year we are selling advance individual show tickets to the three shows we’re putting on a Revolution Hall ([June 2nd: Lance Bangs Presents Come Laugh With Us](https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1145325?utm_source=os), [June 3rd: An Evening with Aimee Mann and Ted Leo (And Friends!)](https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1145343?utm_source=os), [June 4th: Rachel Bloom](https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1145305?utm_source=os)). Apart from those shows, we only sell festival passes in advance. The Standard Festival Pass grants admission to all Bridgetown shows EXCEPT those at Revolution Hall, and the Golden Ticket VIP Pass grants admission to all Bridgetown shows INCLUDING those at Revolution Hall. [You can buy both types of passes here while they’re available](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2016-bridgetown-comedy-festival-june-1-5-tickets-23824633119)!

Apart from that, If you want to attend a single show, you can pay admission as you enter (doors open 30 minutes prior to showtime). This has been Bridgetown’s longtime policy in an attempt to avoid penalizing full festival pass-holders. This way, no matter how popular a single show may be, those with festival passes and those who only want to attend one show have an equal chance at getting in by lining up beforehand.

Note: Individual show tickets are only valid for a single show. They do not grant access for the following shows in the same venue.

**So I bought a festival pass. What now? Where do I pick it up?**

If you bought a standard festival pass, deluxe festival pass or Golden Ticket VIP, you will get a wristband to wear throughout the weekend that grants you admission to shows. To pick up your festival wristband, please bring a printout of your Eventbrite receipt, or show your receipt on your smartphone, or just show a picture ID at any of the 2015 Bridgetown Comedy Festival venues (ONLY DURING THE FESTIVAL -- the venues will only have will call for Bridgetown passes set up half an hour before shows begin). This wristband is what grants admission to shows, and must be worn at all times. If you remove or lose your wristband, you will need to purchase a new one.

**Are tickets transferable?**

No. Your weekend wristband is meant to be worn by you and only you throughout the weekend. If you wish to transfer your ticket into someone else’s name before the festival, you may request to do so by emailing [info@bridgetowncomedy.com](mailto:info@bridgetowncomedy.com)

**Are all shows 21 and over?**

All of the shows in this year's festival are 21 and over. If at any point we add shows to the schedule that are all-ages we’ll be sure to mark them clearly.

**What does my Golden Ticket VIP Pass get me?**

Your VIP Golden Ticket pass grants you front-of-the-line access to shows, a free Bridgetown T-shirt, admission to the June 2nd, 3rd and 4th shows at Revolutiong Hall and admission to the pre-festival meet-and-greet. If you purchased a Golden Ticket, you will receive an email a week before the festival with information on the meet-and-greet via the email address you used when purchasing your pass. We will also contact you to ask for RSVPs for the three Revolution Hall shows so we have accurate head counts.

**Do certain shows forbid late admittance?**

It is a good idea to get to shows early to ensure entry. Once a show has sold out, you will not be able to enter. There may be certain cases that require waiting until a natural break in the performance before late entry is allowed.

**Where can I see a schedule of all the shows in the festival?**

We usually publish the complete festival schedule about three weeks before the festival. Even once published, the schedule and lineup are subject to change.
