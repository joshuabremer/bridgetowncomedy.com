  "bio": "<p>Called a “hardcore comedy critics’ favorite” at the Idaho Laugh Fest by the festival’s director Megan Bryant, who “never had that kind of feedback before from so many people about the same comic,” Becky Braunstein is a rising standout performer with fresh energy and wide-eyed enthusiasm that is impossible to ignore. She grew up on a mountain in Alaska where she had no one to talk to, moved to Portland after being diagnosed with metastatic thyroid cancer and coming close to losing her voice forever - but she didn’t lose it, and now she won’t shut up. Becky was an audience favorite at the 2016 Big Sky Comedy Festival, and has also performed at the All Jane Comedy Festival, the Idaho Laugh Fest, Pickathon, the Siren Nation Festival, NW Women’s Comedy Festival, and the Hudson Valley Comedy Festival. A finalist for ‘Best Comedian’ in the Willamette Week’s 2016 Best of Portland, and selected for Helium Comedy Club’s 2015 ‘Best of Portland’, she performs regularly at Harvey’s Comedy Club and is a host/producer of POWERHOUSE, filmed at Curious Comedy Theater. She studied at the same acting school as Liam Neeson, and has a specific set of skills - which include illustrating #FatAnimals, being able to lip-sync the entirety of ‘Pehla Nasha’ from the 1992 hit Bollywood film Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, and demolitions.</p>\n",
