  "bio": "<p>Phil Schallberger started doing comedy in Portland, Oregon at age 17, sneaking into dive bars and open mics to get as much stage on time as he could. Years later, he&#039;s recognized as one of the most unique and uncompromising comics in the Pacific Northwest and has been featured in the Seattle Sketchfest, San Francisco Sketchfest, Hell Yes Fest, and Bridgetown Comedy Festival. Mixing his years of experience with formal stand-up, sketch, and improv, Phil is able to weave in and out of multimedia, character, and sketch performance. Whether youâ€™re a fan of classic stand-up or looking for something new that combines all your favorite elements of comic performances, Phil Schallberger is the guy for you.</p>\n",
