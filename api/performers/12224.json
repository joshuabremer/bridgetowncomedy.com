  "bio": "<p>Robert Buscemi appeared in the 2015 Louis CK-produced Netflix documentary &quot;Todd Barry: The Crowd Work Tour,&quot; then entered the Marvel Comics universe in January 2016 with a co-star appearance on ABC&#039;s &quot;Agent Carter.&quot; </p>\n<p>Buscemi was voted Best Stand-Up in Chicago by the Reader newspaper and has earned wide praise in the press. He produced two critically acclaimed, hour-long stand-up albums for Rooftop Records, &quot;One Pretty Peacock&quot; (2013) and &quot;Palpable&quot; (2010). He is a veteran of San Francisco Sketch Fest, the Rooftop Aspen Comedy Fest, the Chicago Improv Fest and the DC Comedy Fest, and has twice been an &quot;Andy Kaufman Award&quot; semi-finalist. </p>\n<p>He recorded a marathon podcast for Pete Holmes&#039;s &quot;You Made It Weird&quot; that got kudos for the way both comedians discussed the pain of divorce (important note: NOT FROM EACH OTHER). </p>\n<p>Finally, Buscemi has co-hosted the hit monthly mystery-lineup house-party show &quot;Surprise! with Rob &amp; Sofiya&quot; for four years. In summer 2015 Buscemi, Sofiya Alexandra and Virginia Jones toured California and the Pacific Northwest with the show, staging house-party shows in Portland, Eugene, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Arcata.</p>\n",
