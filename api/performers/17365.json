  "bio": "<p>Hi! I'm stand-up comedian who grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, but I now live in Los Angeles. I've written for and been a regular panelist on Chelsea Lately, I co-hosted (along with Chris Fairbanks) a show called Almost Genius on TruTV for two seasons, I'm on Comedy Central's @midnight pretty often, and I'm on the road a lot as Chris Hardwick's feature act, as well as doing my own shows at comedy clubs and punk clubs all around our nation. I also created and hosted the popular (if I do say so myself, which feels weird) Go Bayside podcast, which ran for two years and critically deconstructed every episode of Saved by the Bell (yes, for real). I still write zines (remember those?) and I've also been told I make pretty good mixtapes. More can be found at aprilrichardson.com.Â </p>\n",
