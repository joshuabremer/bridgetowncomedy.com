  "bio": "<p>Conan and Comedy Central veteran Ahmed Bharoocha is half Irish Catholic, half Pakistani-Indian-Burmese-Muslim, and wholly a master of punctuating striking social commentary with high-energy theatrics. During high school, his family relocated from Santa Barbara to Rhode Island, where Bharoocha made the leap from Stitches Comedy Club dishwasher to open micer. While attending the University of Rhode Island, he frequented Boston’s Comedy Studio, becoming a Comic in Residence in the process. </p>\n<p>In 2010, Bharoocha won the Magner’s International Comedy Festival and soon moved to Los Angeles (specifically his sister’s dining-room floor). There he began producing weekly web shorts with Ryan O’Flanagan and Jack Robichaud for their Dead Kevin YouTube channel; the viral sketch trio has since been featured on Tosh.0, Funny or Die and named one of L.A. Weekly’s 2013 Comedy Acts to Watch. As a solo stand-up, Bharoocha’s festival performances include Just for Laughs Montreal, the Moontower Comedy Festival, Riot L.A., the Great American Comedy Festival and Scotland’s Glasgow International Comedy Festival. Most recently he appeared on Adam DeVine’s House Party, Viceland’s Flophouse and was cast as a series regular on this fall’s Adult Swim series Dream Corp.</p>\n",
