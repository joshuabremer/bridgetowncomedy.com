  "bio": "<p>David Gborie is great at cocktail parties. He&#039;s been touring the country relentlessly for the past few years and has performed on some cool stuff. The New York Comedy Festival, Riot LA, SF Sketchfest, High Plains Comedy Festival, The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail, all that good shit. He was recently named one of Comedy Central&#039;s Top Comics to watch for either 2015 or 2016 (he&#039;s not sure how it works but the credit is legit as fuck and he gonna use it. That&#039;s for damn sure). The kid lives large.</p>\n",
