  "bio": "<p>Ian Abramson is from Moreno Valley, California, where he learned to walk, read, and drive, but not in that order. His stand-up is a mix of precise wordplay, longer emotionally absurd jokes, and larger conceptual pieces. In 2014 Chicago Magazine named Ian “Best Experimental Comedian” and also listed him in a separate article as one of the “16 Comedians You Should See This Fall.” In 2015 Ian was LA Weekly’s Best Up-and-Coming Comedian and a New Face for the world renowned Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, Canada.  </p>\n<p>Ian Abramson is a regular contributor to The Onion and also the creator and host of the buzzed-about Comedy Central digital show 7 Minutes in Purgatory where comedians perform to a camera in one room while the audience watches in another room. He was also a creative consultant for Funny or Die’s digital series Our Fascinating Planet starring Demetri Martin. Ian has appeared on SeeSo’s The Comedy Show Show, Hulu’s Coming to the Stage and performed at Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Pemberton Music Festival in Canada, SXSW and Moontower Comedy Festival in Austin, New York Comedy Festival, San Francisco Sketchfest, Bridgetown Comedy Festival in Portland, The Onion/A.V. Club festival in Chicago and Funny or Die’s Oddball Festival. Recent TV credits include appearances on History Channel’s Join or Die and on ABC’s The Middle.</p>\n",
