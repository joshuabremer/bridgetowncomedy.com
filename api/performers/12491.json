  "bio": "<p>Brendon Small is most known for creating, writing, acting and making the music for both Adult Swimâ€™s \"Metalocalypse\" and \"Home Movies.\" After graduating from Berklee College of Music Small, he began working in the alt. Boston comedy clubs, which led him to pitching and developing TV shows, where he would hire himself to make the music. After 5 records (three of which hold the title for highest charting Death Metal album of all time), he has returned to his stand up roots. His live show, Baked, is the perfect combination of his love for stand up and music.</p>\n",
