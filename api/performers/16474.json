  "bio": "<p>Andrew Sleighter started in comedy looking for the perfect funny line to open a biography. Since then, Andrew’s laid-back style and clever writing has won him appreciation from fans and respect from his peers.</p>\n<p>A regular at colleges and comedy clubs across the country,  Andrew’s also performed (and gotten drunk) at some of the most prestigious comedy festivals in and out of the country including Bumbershoot, Bridgetown, The Cabo Comedy Festival, The Aspen Comedy  Festival, Laughing Skull, and the Johnny Carson Great American Comedy Festival.</p>\n<p>Andrew wrote and blogged for the Sports Show with Norm Macdonald on Comedy Central and was a regular on the MTV prank show Money From Strangers. He’s performed on Nuvo TV’s Stand Up &amp; Deliver, Last Comic Standing, and made his late-night stand-up debut on Conan in 2016.</p>\n<p>Andrew’s comedy has the ability to reach wide ranges of audiences and works in a diversity of rooms. Reliable and consistent, he rarely ends a show by lighting the stage on fire out of rage. Most importantly, he’s constantly fascinated by and eager to keep learning about stand-up.</p>\n",
