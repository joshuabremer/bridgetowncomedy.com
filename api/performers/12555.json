  "bio": "<p>With appearances on TOSH.0, The Late Late show, The Smoking Gun Presents, Conan and his own half hour special on Comedy Central, Jay Larson has come a long way since he moved to Los Angeles in 2000. After flunking out of college, then finally getting accepted back after many attempts, Jay threw away his diploma to pursue a career in standup comedy.</p>\n<p>After living in a condemned house for 14 months, I mean who hasn’t, Jay started opening for comedy greats such as Nick Swardson, Daniel Tosh and Pablo Fransisco. He soon became known as a comedian with a wacky, original voice who tends to get a little weird. Since those early days Jay has continued climbing the ranks with multiple TV appearances, many internet short films and his first album, “Self-Diagnosed,” available on iTunes. His voice continues to grow as he has delved into the world of interacting with strangers and creating conflict with people he doesn’t know. Jay is a fantastic storyteller, showcased weekly on The Crabfeast Podcast with co-host Ryan Sickler. With TV projects in development, be sure to catch Jay now before he ignores everyone…forever…seriously…he will.</p>\n",
