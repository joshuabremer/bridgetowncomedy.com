  "bio": "<p>Caitlin Weierhauser spent her childhood in an Ewok tree fort with a rubber band cross-bow, her wolf, and a budding resentment of The Man. She grew up to be a tantrum-prone queer, feminist, vegan liar that creates safer comedy spaces and is never happier than when she&#039;s mad. </p>\n<p>Caitlin is a member of Lez Stand Up and has performed at All Jane Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot, and Seattle Sketchfest. She was included in the AfterEllen list of &quot;40 Hot Queer Ladies in Comedy,&quot; and plans to dismantle the patriarchy by Christmas.</p>\n",
