  "bio": "<p>Simon Gibson is an L.A based standup comedian who was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. He has been performing his boisterous style of comedy for the last 5 years and has garnered a good reputation in both the alt-scene and more traditional club scene. He was also electrocuted on stage one time to an applause break because no one thought it was really happening because his act-outs are so believable. He almost died. Which would&#039;ve been tight as hell.</p>\n",
