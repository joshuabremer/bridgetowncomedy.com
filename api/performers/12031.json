Schinderle has been known to win crowds over with her pervy charm. JoAnn had the honor of being chosen out of 800+ applicants to open for Lena Dunham on her ‘Not That Kind of Girl’ book tour in a sold out show at Portland’s Newmark Theatre. </p>\n<p>As a working stand up at Helium Comedy Club- Portland, her humor is relatable, snarky, and has a storytelling style that will make you feel like she’s your best friend letting you in on a secret.  Also trained as an improvisor through courses at Second City Training Center and Curious Comedy Theater, JoAnn creates big characters and will “yes and” the shit out of you. JoAnn has appeared on Rooftop Comedy, Fight Stigma Web Series, and is a contributing writer for Laugh Staff. She also hosts, curates, and produces a weekly stand up showcase called Control Yourself: A Showcase of Funny, which has been featured as &#039;Top 5 Portland Comedy Showcases to Watch’ 2 years running by the Willamette Week.
