  "bio": "<p>Patrick Susmilch started his stand-up odyssey at the tender age of 20. Now, at the tender age of 29, he has transformed into a beautiful and wounded comedic butterfly. With a cheerfully sardonic viewpoint, he’s not afraid to tackle the big topics: kittens, hair loss, and wind chimes. Patrick’s style, which straddles the line between irreverence and poignancy, recently secured him an appearance on season 8 of NBC’s &#039;Last Comic Standing.&#039; His debut album &#039;Validate Me&#039; will be available on iTunes April 15th.</p>\n",
