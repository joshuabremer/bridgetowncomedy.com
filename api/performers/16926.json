  "bio": "<p>In addition to performing standup comedy for the last ten years at places including Bumbershoot and High Plains Comedy Festival, Andy Wood has written for and produced shows such as Science Channel's How To Build Everything, E!'s Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings, Ridiculousness, and the MTV Movie Awards. He also produced and acted in Jason Nash Is Married, the first feature released by Comedy Centralâ€™s CC: Studios. Andy's the director of both the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and along with Matt Kirshen he co-hosts the weekly podcast Probably Science, allowing him to trick his parents into believing he hasn't wasted his engineering degree. He's also obsessed with trivia, and if you ask him to join your pub quiz team he is honor-bound to accept.</p>\n",
