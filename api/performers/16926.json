  "bio": "<p>In addition to performing standup comedy for the last ten years at places including Bumbershoot and High Plains Comedy Festival, Andy Wood has written for and produced shows such as E!'s Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings, Ridiculousness, the MTV Movie Awards and an upcoming program for Discovery's Science Channel. He also produced and acted in Jason Nash Is Married, the first feature released by Comedy Central’s CC: Studios. Andy's the director of both the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and the LA Podcast Festival, and along with Matt Kirshen and Jesse Case he co-hosts the weekly podcast Probably Science, allowing him to trick his parents into believing he hasn't wasted his engineering degree. He's also a bit trivia-obsessed, and if you ask him to join your pub quiz team he is honor-bound to accept.</p>\n",
