He was named one of the &quot;Funniest Five&quot; by the Willamette Week, &quot;Portland&#039;s Jimmy Kimmel&quot; by The Oregonian, and his show Earthquake Hurricane was the Willamette Week&#039;s pick for best comedy show in the city. He&#039;s also the creator and host of the live talk show &quot;Late Night Action w/ Alex Falcone&quot; and the surprisingly popular podcast &quot;Read it and Weep,&quot; in which people pay him to suffer through bad books and movies. One time he was on the IFC show &quot;Portlandia&quot; and he still gets emails about it.</p>\n<p>He&#039;s performed at the The Meltdown w/ Jonah and Kumail and Hot Tub Show w/ Kurt and Kristin in Los Angeles plus The Brooklyn Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot in Seattle, Sketchfest in San Francisco, and Hell Yes Fest in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>Despite these modest accomplishments, he somehow remains totally down to earth and dresses in an approachable manner.</p>\n",
