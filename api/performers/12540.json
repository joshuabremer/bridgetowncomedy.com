He also produced and acted in Jason Nash Is Married, the first feature released by Comedy Centralâ€™s CC: Studios. Andy's the director of both the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and the LA Podcast Festival, and along with Matt Kirshen and Jesse Case he co-hosts the weekly podcast Probably Science, allowing him to trick his parents into believing he hasn't wasted his engineering degree.</p>\n<p>He's also a bit trivia-obsessed, and if you ask him to join your pub quiz team he is honor-bound to accept.</p>\n",
