  "bio": "<p>If the adage is true — that tragedy plus time equals comedy — then Ryan Sickler has paid his dues on the left side of the equation. Born in Baltimore, Ryan lost his father when he was 16. After that, he bounced from one relative to another. And while his early years might have seemed rocky, that tumultuous childhood gave him both fodder for material and armor against the relentless onslaught that is life as a standup comic.</p>\n<p>His television appearances include Ovation's The Art of Comedy, TBS’s The Pete Holmes Show, Comedy Central’s Tosh.O, Live At Gotham and Cutman and CBS’s The Late Late Show. Ryan is also an informed sports fan and appeared as a regular on Fox Sports.</p>\n<p>Beyond standup, Ryan Sickler is an engaging storyteller. You can catch him every Tuesday on his podcast, The CrabFeast. Inspired by his hometown, the show celebrates the things Ryan loves most — storytelling, family, friends and comedy.</p>\n",
