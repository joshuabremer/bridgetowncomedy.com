  "bio": "<p>Beginning comedy in her hometown of Chicago, Julia Shiplett has been performing standup and telling stories for the past four years. Her comedy has evolved into a seamless blend of feminism, self-deprecation and personal experiences as a biracially confused Midwesterner. She often explores key topics like pop culture, women&#039;s issues and gross things happening to her body.</p>\n<p>She has been seen in the Brooklyn Comedy Festival, Hell Yes Fest, Cinder Block Comedy Fest and the Chicago Women’s Funny Fest. Other credits include winning a Moth StorySLAM and making it to the 2015 StandUp NBC semifinals. </p>\n<p>Now in New York, Julia co-produces two popular comedy shows in Brooklyn called DEVOUR HOUR &amp; Side Ponytail.</p>\n<p>She’s been told she would make an adorable villain.</p>\n",
