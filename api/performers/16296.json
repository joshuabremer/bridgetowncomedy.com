  "bio": "<p>Mike Lester is a wizard without any powers except comedy. When Mike was 13, he was dropped into the same vat of chemicals that created the Joker. Instead of a life or crime and murder, however, Mike picked up a microphone to exercise his many demons and to let audiences in on the twisted, warped reality he calls home. Sometimes dark, sometimes goofy, always blisteringly funny, Lester never fails to leave audiences reeling with his pointed rants on romance, pugs, and family dynamics. You will simultaneously want to adopt him, leave him at a train Station, And adopt him again when you catch your breath from laughing.</p>\n<p>Don&#039;t miss your chance to see this demented comedy prodigy that has worked with, and received rave reviews from, some of the biggest names in stand up, and all before he can legally rent a car. Aside from working all the major clubs in the midwest, (Acme, Skyline Comedy Cafe, etc) Lester is beginning to bring his unique brand of humor to the coasts and it&#039;s only a matter of time before this lanky comic wizard winds up on your television.</p>\n",
