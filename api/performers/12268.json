  "bio": "<p>Mostly Heather Thomson is just trying to get from day to day or hour to hour depending on how things are “going”.  When she’s not doing that she’s charming audiences with her delightfully agitated thoughts and ramblings.  She performs regularly at the Hollywood Improv, UCB Theater, NerdMelt and for a lot of gay men.  She stared in her own web series “Print Models”, where she cast herself as a model and dared anyone to question that, and produced the live show Tea Time with Thomson.  She has done some other marginally impressive things and loves you very much.</p>\n",
