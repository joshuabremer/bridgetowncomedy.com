  "bio": "<p>Kathleen Kanz is the winner of the 2016 Vermont’s Funniest Comedian contest and the first woman to hold that title.  In January 2016, she hosted/opened for Gilbert Gottfried, the first national headliner at the newly opened Vermont Comedy Club.  She’s been producing and performing comedy in Vermont since 2007.  Her style favors compact jokes containing twisted logic.  She’s the founder of two popular and successful annual events: the Green Mountain Comedy Festival (2009), and Comic Relief - A Benefit for COTS (2013).  She has jokes in two books, “She&#039;s So Funny” and “Squeaky Clean Comedy” and was published in the debut issue of &quot;Swivel – The Nexus of Women &amp; Wit&quot;.</p>\n",
