  "bio": "<p>From his elaborate characters and sketches, to his provocative songs and animation, Drennon has made a name for himself as one of the most innovative minds in today’s comedy scene. His live performances of the Imaginary Radio Program combine live music and beat-boxing with one-man sketches into a show that the Los Angeles Comedy Bureau writes \"not only lives up to its name, but exceeds expectation in what you could possibly think it is.\"</p>\n<p>Drennon recently appeared on TBS’s <em>Conan</em>, and has previously appeared on Comedy Central's <em>Adam Devine's House Party</em>, NBC's <em>Last Call</em> and was a semifinalist on <em>Last Comic Standing</em>.  His animated show The Long Legs can be seen on MTV's New Liquid Television. Drennon also provided the theme song to Seeso’s <em>The Show Show</em>, which also features Drennon’s Imaginary Radio Program live show.</p>\n<p>He was featured in LA Weekly's Top 10 Comedy Acts to Watch in 2014 and 2015 Best Comedy Duo (with Karen Kilgariff), as well as Splitsider's Top 10 Up &amp; Coming Acts in LA in 2015.
