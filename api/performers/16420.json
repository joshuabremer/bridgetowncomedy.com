Devon was recently featured on the Moontower Comedy Festival, and was named a Semi-Finalist in the Funniest Person in Austin Competition. Devon has a Master&#039;s degree in a field that nobody knows about. Devon doesn&#039;t really like writing bios about himself. Come support his shows so that he can pursue his dreams of having someone else write bios for him.</p>\n",
