  "bio": "<p>Gilbert Lawand left the corporate world in 2007 and helped usher in an Atlanta comedy boom by producing and hosting over 300 shows called &quot;Comedy Gold&quot;. In 2015 he was a finalist in the Laughing Skull Festival and also produced the first annual Red Clay Comedy Festival. Gilbert has opened up large theater shows for both Dave Chappelle and Aziz Ansari. His comedy is a mix of social commentary and satire through a unique perspective based on his background: born in Baghdad to Catholic parents before moving to a town of 500 people in Georgia where he grew up on a farm. He recently moved to New York where he resides in Brooklyn.</p>\n",
