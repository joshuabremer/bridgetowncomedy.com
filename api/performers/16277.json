  "bio": "<p>Ismael Loutfi is a sweet boy with a kind face. He’s been called “gifted,” “quick-witted,” and a “neurotic toe-rag” by numerous friends’ parents. Underneath that sweetness lies a deeply acerbic sense of humor- the sort of thing you might develop growing up a Muslim in rural North Florida. In 2016, he was a finalist in the Laughing Skull Comedy Festival. A month later, he went on to be a New Face of comedy at the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. Since then, he has been a Stand Up NBC finalist and Comic to Watch at LA’s Riot Comedy Festival. He can be seen on the VICELAND series Flophouse.</p>\n",
