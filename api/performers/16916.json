  "bio": "<p>Nico Santos stars as Mateo on NBC's comedy \"Superstore.\" Santos was born and raised in the Philippines and assimilated into American culture rather quickly by living in California by way of Portland, Oregon. He started doing stand up in San Francisco and, in just a short amount of time, conquered the Bay Area comedy scene with his acute observations and quirky characters.</p>\n<p>Charming audiences all across the country with his sharp sarcastic wit and outrageous sensibility, Santos has that rare ability to be crass and snarky while at the same time remaining completely likable. Santos has written for E! Network's \"Fashion Police\" and appeared on screen on Showtime's \"Pride Comedy Jam,\" as well as \"Ground Floor,\" \"Mulaney\" and \"2 Broke Girls.\" He was also a regular panelist on \"Chelsea Lately\" and made his film debut in \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.\"Â </p>\n",
