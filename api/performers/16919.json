  "bio": "<p>Jackie Kashian is a comic, podcaster, writer, actor and occasional  bottle washer if there's some attention to garnered. Jackie's brand new album, I'm Not The Hero Of This Story, was #1 comedy album on iTunes and Amazon the first week of its release and is critically acclaimed. She is in the eleventh year of her podcast The Dork Forest, where she talks with people about what they love to do, think about and collect. All things are dorky and it's dork on dork dialog. She also has a new podcast on the Nerdist Network with Laurie Kilmartin called The Jackie and Laurie Show. And, seriously, that's just talking about comedy. <a href=\"http://www.jackiekashian.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.jackiekashian.com</a> has links to it all. </p>\n",
