  "bio": "<p>Rhea Butcher is a Los Angeles-based stand-up comic, actor and writer who has appeared on NBC’ s Last Comic Standing, Buzzfeed and Funny Or Die Presents. Originally from the Midwest, Rhea grew up skateboarding the mean streets of Akron, Ohio. Her blue collar brand of cool has endeared her to audiences nationwide, both in her live appearances opening for comics like Pete Holmes, Anthony Jeselnik, Maria Bamford and Cameron Esposito in large theatre venues, or her podcast appearances on shows like You Made It Weird, How Did This Get Made? and Sklarboro Country. In 2016, Rhea will debut her first television series, “Take My Wife” for NBCUniversal’s new Seeso platform, launch a web series on Legendary/Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls Network, host recurring segments as the first correspondent on Paul F. Tompkins’ “No You Shut Up” on Fusion, appear at SF Sketchfest for the 3rd year running and release her first stand-up album with Kill Rock Stars Records.</p>\n",
