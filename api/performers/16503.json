  "bio": "<p>One of Riot LA comedy festival&#039;s comics to watch (2017), Stephen Agyei has the whitest teeth in Denver. One of the city&#039;s most sought-after comedians shines as brightly as his mischievous smile, not to mention a style described as “calculated fearlessness.” A regular at Comedy Works, Stephen has opened for some of the most prominent comedians in the country. The Limestone Comedy Festival alum (2016) has toured internationally in South Korea, and was hand picked by Duncan Trussell to open for his most recent &quot;I am God&quot; tour (2016). Stephen was introduced to a national audience thanks to his TV debut on VICELAND’s Flophouse (2016), as well as being featured on NPR&#039;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;(2016) with Roy Wood Jr. A finalist in the 2012 Great American Comedy Festival, winner of the 2012 Comedy Works’ Clean Comedy Contest,&#039; and 3-time finalist in the venue’s New Faces contest, he quickly made a name for himself on the Denver scene.</p>\n",
