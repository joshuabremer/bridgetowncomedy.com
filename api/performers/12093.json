  "bio": "<p>Jon Washington is a comedian hailing from Portland, Oregon. His style pairs up absurd flights of fancy with a rumbling deadpan, which may not work so hot in print, since you’re probably reading this aloud in a wacky fun voice. Critics have been divided on how this persona adds up, calling him everything from “instantly likable” to “immediately likable.” He’s the taste you can see.</p>\n<p>You may have seen Washington before, maybe even in a live comedy context. He’s had the privilege of performing at the Bumbershoot Music and Arts Festival, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and less festive environs, such as Helium Comedy Club and Live Wire Radio. </p>\n<p>Beyond the live comedy stage, Jon Washington’s thrown himself at other pursuits, many of them worth the trouble. He stalwartly hosts his podcasts Jon Reads the Paper, which is exactly what it sounds like, and These are the People, a tongue-meets-cheek parody of public radio. He also wrote and co-produced The Spicy News, which to this date stands as the sweatiest channel on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Jon Washington’s comedy is smart, accessible and has made some lists, just like that book you pretend to read on the bus. He’s such a nice young man; it’s just a shame he had to go with this whole ‘comedy’ thing.</p>\n",
