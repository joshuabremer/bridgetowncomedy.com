Instead, she offers up intelligent and hilarious material, with impeccable timing and a wry smile.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Emily was chosen to represent Chicago in the &quot;Best of the Midwest&quot; competition at Gilda&#039;s LaughFest. She was a semi-finalist in NBC&#039;s Stand Up for Diversity, and finalist in the “Bob and Tom” comedy contest held in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>Emily performs regularly at the legendary Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago, and has traveled the country to work with national acts such as Jeffery Ross, Gilbert Gottfried, Dwayne Perkins, Jimmy Dore, Jeff Richards, Kyle Kinane, and Matt Braunger. You can also catch her on your TV, performing on shows like “The Comedy Thrift Store,” “Funny Sundaes,” and Comcast On Demand&#039;s “Laugh Out Loud”.</p>\n<p>In 2014 Emily appeared on NBC’s “Last Comic Standing” and the nationally syndicated “Comic’s Unleashed”.</p>\n<p>Emily was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona where she enjoyed sunny days and swimming in December.
