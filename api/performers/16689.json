  "bio": "<p>First stepping on stage in Omaha, NE and later relocating to Austin, TX in 2010, Cody quickly became a favorite all over Texas and has since been featured at such festivals as the Montreal JFL Festival, Moontower Comedy Festival, SXSW, and Fun Fun Fun Fest. A finalist in the 2010, '11, '12, '13, and winner of the 2014 Funniest Person In Austin Contest, Cody has been described as offering thoughtful, methodic, absurdity complimented by a unique delivery and timing. These certainly aren't the bird, poop, and dick jokes your parents grew up knowing and loving.</p>\n",
