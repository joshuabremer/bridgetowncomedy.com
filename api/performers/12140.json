  "bio": "<p>Mia Jackson is a Georgia peach (local for native) and a self-proclaimed know-it-all, and always wondered what would happen if she took her sense of humor to the stage. And thatâ€™s exactly what she did! After graduating from the University of Georgia she hit the local comedy scene and has thrilled audiences since day one.  To her credit she has appeared on Oxygen, TLC,  Nick]&#039;s Night Out, LAFF,  and was recently a semi-finalist on Season 9 of NBC&#039;s Last Comic Standing in 2015.    She has done comedy festivals from SF SketchFest to Boston&#039;s Women in Comedy Festival - and anything and everything in between.   Mia is a diverse comedian with an outspoken voice and a unique perspective. Her energetic, conversational style leaves the audience as if they&#039;ve known her forever. Smart, funny, and versatile, Mia always delivers - whether it be an alt comedy club, a college campus, or metro mainsteam comedy stages.  In addition, she is a budding actress - and will appear in Gary Marshall&#039;s new film MOTHER&#039;S DAY as herself!  She has already signed on for the follow up films, Father&#039;s Day, Labor Day, Arbour Day, and Boxing Day.</p>\n",
