  "bio": "<p>History tells us that Andrew Orolfo was never born, but created. In some cultures, their stories suggest he emerged from the magma of an active volcano, unaffected by it&#039;s immense temperatures. His only purpose is to wander the world and document his explorations. After an expedition that lasted for decades, he became lost, with no one to share his discoveries. But then he found himself in a place called the Bay Area where he was introduced to stand-up comedy. Now he is able to reveal his tales of what he was and what he has yet to become.</p>\n",
