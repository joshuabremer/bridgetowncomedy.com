  "bio": "<p>Hello my name is Aaron Black, I&#039;m a stand up comic, writer, and actor? I reside in Los Angeles, where I co-produce a show called the Brew HaHa (the comedy drinking game), which has been written up in LA Weekly and Time Out LA. I also rent out paddle boats on Echo Lake...you know...for money. In 2016 I won Best Stand Up in the 19th Los Angeles Comedy Festival (this officially ends the comedic accomplishment portion of this bio). I have performed at SF Sketchfest, Riot LA, and Green Mountain Comedy Festival, and have performed with Sarah Tiana, Jim Jeffries, Todd Glass, Kyle Kinane, and Maria Bamford (I&#039;m pretty sure they didn&#039;t stick around for my set).  When I&#039;m not on stage talking about Jill (my ex) I write sketches that have been featured on Funny or Die and The Laugh Button. I&#039;m not over my ex, which is painfully obvious on stage. People say comedy is like therapy, and every time I grab a mic it is my mission to get people to stop saying that. It doesn&#039;t work.</p>\n",
