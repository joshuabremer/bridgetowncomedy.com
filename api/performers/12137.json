We like to think of Natalie as something all out-of-left-field and supremely committed to her characters...&quot; </p>\n<p>She is a founding member of LA&#039;s absurdist clown group, Wet the Hippo, directed by John Gilkey. She also worked as a creative consultant with the Obie-Award-Winning Pig Iron Theatre Company on a devised play titled &quot;I Promised Myself to Live Faster&quot; which premiered at the 2015 Humana Festival.
