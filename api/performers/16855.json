  "bio": "<p>Maggie Maye loves candy almost as much as she also loves performing comedy. She made her late night debut on Conan and was featured in AXS TV<br />\npresents: Gotham Comedy Live. She’s performed in the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, San Francisco Sketchfest (as one of the Sketchfest Dozen), Moontower Comedy &amp; Oddity Festival, SXSW, and the All Jane Comedy Festival. She’s opened for Hannibal Burress, Paul Rodriguez, Gladys Knight, and Earth, Wind and Fire. Her work has been featured in the Huffington Post, Variety, LaughSpin, and the New York Times. She’s been named a comic to watch by Splitsider, the Austin American Statesman, and the Austin Chronicle (who also named her as 2016 Best of Austin Stand up comic). Maggie is also a member of award winning improv and sketch shows, Damn, Gina! and Doper than Dope. Her comedy is described the same way she is: sassy, charming, and smart. A 6-year-old once told her she was the funniest person ever. And kids rarely lie.</p>\n",
