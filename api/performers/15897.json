She has performed in the Boston Comedy Festival, the Limestone Comedy Festival, the Brooklyn Comedy Festival and the New York Comedy Festival, and has opened for Aparna Nancherla, Beth Stelling, Mark Normand, Charlie Pickering, Carmen Lynch, and SNL&#039;s Aidy Bryant. Since moving to New York she has performed in venues all over the city including UCB and Night Train at Littlefield.
