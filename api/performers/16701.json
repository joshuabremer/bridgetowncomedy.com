  "bio": "<p>Named one of Rolling Stone’s Five Comics to Watch with standout appearances on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Conan, The Late Late show, Last Comic Standing, Comedy Central, and Showtime, he’s establishing himself as one of the nation’s favorite stand-ups.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He’s impressed industry insiders by racking up a remarkable number of national competition wins and festival appearances, including winning The Great American Comedy Festival and Sierra Mist’s America’s Next Great Comic Search. He’s also a regular performer at the Just For Laughs Comedy Festivals with several international television performances including The Muppets Gala in Montreal and the Sydney Opera House International Comedy Gala.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He’s often lauded for being a clean comedian, although his audiences span a broad spectrum. One review said, “His stories and delivery are so funny, it doesn’t even cross your mind that he works completely clean. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. When he talks about his experience skydiving or taking a hot-air-balloon ride, you’re too busy laughing to notice he’s not like the others.” (from Vancouver Georgia Straight “For Comic Ryan Hamilton Getting Clean Laughs Just Comes Naturally”)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Growing up in Idaho and making his home in New York City he’s far from his small-town roots, but the contrast suits him. He’s currently headlining comedy clubs across the country building a following of enthusiastic fans.</p>\n",
