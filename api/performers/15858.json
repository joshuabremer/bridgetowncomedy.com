  "bio": "<p>Brodie is a Los Angeles native who translates a tough, unconventional childhood into an act that expresses the desire to be understood on a broader emotional spectrum while also chronicling the pursuit of comfort. Black, nerdy, politically conscious, he has been slowing rising through the ranks of the LA comedy scene, featured in dozens of sketches and performing at venues like the Improv. and raised in Inglewood, California. Heâ€™ll transition from Black Lives Matter to Star Trek material with a genuine, trademark giggle</p>\n",
