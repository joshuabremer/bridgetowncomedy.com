  "bio": "<p>Katie McCarthy’s comedic sensibility has been described as “kinda weird,” “stop it,” and “BEAST.” A favorite at Boston’s legendary Comedy Studio, she was their Comic in Residence in January 2016. Katie performed in the Boston leg of the 2013 Eugene Mirman Comedy Festival, the 2015 Philly Improv Theater Black Friday Comedy Marathon, 2016 Bird City Comedy Festival, and three times on the Nerdist Network’s Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction Podcast. She brings laughter all over New England all the time.</p>\n",
