  "bio": "<p>Seattle's Wimps is a three-piece comprised of scene veterans Rachel Ratner (Butts) on guitar and lead vocals, Matt Nyce (Meth Teeth) on bass and backing vocals, and Dave Ramm (The Intelligence) on drums. Wimps serve their own brand of rapid-fire punk with a smattering of lo-fi post punk guitar work to create an angular, slightly off-kilter blast. Ratner lyrically twists otherwise common day-to-day woes into relatable tales of struggle shout-sung call and response stabs that champion boredom, laziness and social anxieties with wiry riffs and punchy bass lines, propelled by the measured rhythms of drummer David Ramm. In 2015 they partnered with Kill Rock Stars and released a cassette and their sophomore album ‘Suitcase’ to praise from places like Noisey, Nerdist, AV Club, Exclaim, Norman Records, the Stranger, and more. The band will be touring the East Coast in April 2016 and heading to Europe in late June.</p>\n",
