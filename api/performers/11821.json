  "bio": "<p>Memphis-born comic, Nerd Culture Enthusiast, and Black Nerd Power Podcast Host,<br />\nRichard Douglas Jones started performing at open mics in Memphis to recover from<br />\ndepression, after a succession of hapless happenings left him more than slightly<br />\nmisanthropic. He found deliverance in comedy and audiences found his wildly<br />\ninappropriate and caustic wit hilarious. Both a nice guy and a dubious miscreant, his<br />\ndelivery is a mash up of incisive insights on everyday life, Nerd Culture from a Black<br />\nPOV, dating, sex, politics, and race. </p>\n<p>RDJ is what happens when one guy finds his tribe of weirdos and let&#039;s his Freak Flag<br />\nproudly fly!</p>\n",
