  "bio": "<p>Mike Lebovitz began his comedy career at the age of six with clowning classes at the local JCC. He&#039;s been delighting and confounding audiences with his intoxicating brand of wild-eyed humor ever since. Equal parts lovable and absurd, Mike&#039;s act careens from topic to topic like a runaway freight train with some questionable couplings. Audiences have described the experience as &quot;spontaneous,&quot; &quot;joyful&quot; and &quot;slightly terrifying.&quot; </p>\n<p>A burgeoning international star now based in New York, Mike has offended nostrils in Montreal as a &quot;New Face&quot; of the 2013 Just For Laughs, and in Switzerland where he won the international competition at the 2013 The Montreux Comedy Fest. He returned to Montreux in 2014 as the &quot;Godfather&quot; of the competition.</p>\n",
