  "bio": "<p>I&#039;m not doing that 3rd person tense as if someone else wrote this.  I started out writing and acting but I always wanted to be funny. I love stand up.  I like to make it feel like we&#039;re in a bar or living room where you can talk shit about anything and make it funny.  I split my time between Vancouver and LA.  Most recently, I won 1st place in the 2015 Seattle International Comedy Competition. In 2016, I made my standup television debut on Comedy Central’s “Adam Devine’s House Party.”  I have opened up for Hannibal Buress, Reggie Watts and toured with Chris D&#039;elia on the “Under No Influence Tour.”  </p>\n<p>My debut CD  “Choosy Lover” is available to stream at <a href=\"http://www.dinoarchie.com\">www.dinoarchie.com</a> </p>\n<p>REVIEWS:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.straight.com/arts/388196/las-dino-archie-works-his-laughs-vancouver\">http://www.straight.com/arts/388196/las-dino-archie-works-his-laughs-van...</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://beatroute.ca/2014/12/15/is-this-a-joke-comics-camaraderie-at-the-electric-owl/\">http://beatroute.ca/2014/12/15/is-this-a-joke-comics-camaraderie-at-the-...</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.straight.com/arts/760251/dino-archie-comedy-mix\">http://www.straight.com/arts/760251/dino-archie-comedy-mix</a></p>\n",
