  "bio": "<p>Tom Thakkar (formerly Thomas Brady) is a comic living in Brooklyn by way of Bloomington, IN and Chicago. He is the son of a great, Red Lobster-managing mom and a deadbeat Indian dad, giving him the odd childhood experience of being a poor, pudgy Indian boy in southern Indiana. In 2015, Tom was named a “New Face” by the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, as well as one of the “Best of the Midwest” by Gilda’s Laugh Fest. Ole Tom Thakkar has also been a featured performer at Limestone Comedy Festival, Chicago Comedy Exposition, Crom Fest Omaha, and more. Tom has been featured on Doug Loves Movies, VICE, NPR, The Todd Glass Show, PBS, and was named a &quot;Comedian you should know&quot; by Chicago Magazine. You can see Tom all over New York, opening for Nikki Glaser all over the country, or standing outside of a Chipotle trying to decide if he&#039;s earned it that day.</p>\n",
