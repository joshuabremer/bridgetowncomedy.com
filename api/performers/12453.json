  "bio": "<p>Los Angeles comedian Nick Youssef has been working the standup circuit since the tender age of 18, steadily building a following and working his way into the national spotlight. He just released his debut comedy album Stop Not Owning This on iTunes.</p>\n<p>Nick also hosts the \"Occasionally Awesome\" podcast with fellow comedian Kevin Christy, where they shun convention by discussing style, music, and art more than comedy. With his unique perspective in mind, we talked to Nick about what he likes to wear on stage, his own personal style, and what every man should and should not wear.</p>\n",
