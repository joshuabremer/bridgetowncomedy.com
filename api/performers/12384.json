  "bio": "<p>Raghav Mehta is an aggressively nervous comedian and writer living and breathing in the frosty metropolis of Minneapolis, MN. He was named one of Growler&#039;s &#039;Top 5 MN Comics To Watch&#039; in 2015 and is the co-producer of the monthly comedy show Good Night America. He&#039;s had the pleasure of opening for Maria Bamford, Emo Phillips and Hari Kondabolu and his work has been published in Thought Catalog, City Pages and Minnesota Public Radio. Most days he can be found flailing at a nearby open mic, researching water futures or getting back at the world one caustic tweet at the time. Once when he was 5-years old he stole a deck of Batman Returns-themed playing cards from a drug store in upstate New York and never looked back. He is also brown and needs your love.</p>\n",
