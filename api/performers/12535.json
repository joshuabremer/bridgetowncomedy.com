  "bio": "<p>In the decades since going solo following the success of her band 'Til Tuesday, Aimee Mann has made a name for herself as one of the greatest singer/songwriters of her generation. In 1993 and 1995 she released the albums Whatever and I'm With Stupid, and then collaborated with director Paul Thomas Anderson to contribute eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's film Magnolia. The song \"Save Me\" was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Grammy, and introduced Mann to an even wider audience. Since then, Aimee released Lost in Space (2000), 2004's Live at St. Ann's Warehouse (a live album and DVD) and the concept album The Forgotten Arm (2005). In 2005, veering farther off the beaten path, Mann released a Christmas EP, following it up in 2006 with One More Drifter in the Snow, a full-length Christmas album. Her eighth solo studio album, Charmer, came out in 2012, and her collaboration The Both with fellow Bridgetown performer Ted Leo was released in 2014.</p>\n",
