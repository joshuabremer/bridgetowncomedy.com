  "bio": "<p>Amanda Arnold is a Portland based stand up comic. As soon as Amanda gets on stage you&#039;re ready to laugh. This self proclaimed &quot;chubby not ugly&quot; joke slinger delivers the funny from the very start. Amanda&#039;s fast paced, extremely funny comedic style landed her on Laughs on Fox and snagged her a spot in the  Willamette Weeks &quot;Funniest 5&quot; in 2016. You may have also got a chance to see her in the the All Jane Comedy Festival or The Idaho Laugh Fest last year!  Amanda did stand up comedy for the first time when she was 8 years old! Yes! You read that correctly! It&#039;s no wonder you get a feeling when watching her that some people are just born funny.</p>\n",
