  "bio": "<p>Amanda Arnold is a Portland based stand up comic. This self proclaimed &quot;chubby not ugly&quot; joke slinger delivers the funny from the very start. Amanda&#039;s fast paced, extremely funny comedic style landed her on Laughs on Fox and snagged her a spot in Willamette Week&#039;s &quot;Funniest 5&quot; in 2016. You may have also seen her in the the All Jane Comedy Festival or The Idaho Laugh Fest in 2016!  Amanda did stand up comedy for the first time when she was 8 years old! Yes! You read that correctly! It&#039;s no wonder you get a feeling when watching her that some people are just born funny.</p>\n",
