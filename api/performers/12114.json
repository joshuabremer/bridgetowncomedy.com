  "bio": "<p>Leah Mansfield is a former Air Force officer turned comedian. This fun loving...and woman loving...comic has also made many other terrible life decisions. Come hear stories about her family, poor decisions, and of course, Nuclear Weapons. She&#039;s traveled extensively around the country doing festivals and opening for more famous people, and would make a great president if having beer with the President was all this country needed.</p>\n",
