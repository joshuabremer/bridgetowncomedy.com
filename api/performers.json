      "bio": "<p>Since the early '90s, Ted Leo has been one of the most progressive forces in East Coast independent music, with a unique combination of punk and folk, soul and hardcore, and tradition and experimentation. Originally rising to a small degree of fame in the late-'80s New York hardcore scene by playing with Citizen's Arrest and Animal Crackers, Leo left New York for Washington, D.C., in 1990, when he founded and fronted Chisel, one of the first mod/punk revival outfits to gain national renown. Leo was the primary songwriter and singer of Chisel, recording two full-length records with the band which were released on Gern Blandsten in the mid-'90s and leading the band on countless short tours. The songwriting was as infectious and calculated as that of Brit rock legends the Kinks, yet the rhythms remained fueled by the anthemic energy reminiscent of bands like the Who and the Clash. </p>\n<p>Chisel's eventual breakup in 1997 came after their critically acclaimed sophomore full-length, Set You Free. The band's reputation seemed to flourish after their breakup, however, and even though the retro trends in indie rock would eventually gain enough popularity to inspire the likes of mod underground sweethearts like the Mooney Suzuki and the Delta 72, the influence of Chisel goes largely unnoticed. Leo went on to a variety of musical endeavors, including two years of on-again, off-again touring as a guitarist with the Spinanes, and a short-lived project called the Sin Eaters that he founded with his brother, Danny Leo, on drums and former Van Pelt bassist Sean Greene. The Sin Eaters' progressive, politically charged, punk-fused rock and local all-star lineup took the New York underground by storm between 1997 and 1998, until Danny Leo left the band to work on his own material and eventually founded the Holy Childhood. </p>\n<p>In the spring of 2000, Leo's sophomore effort, Treble in Trouble, was released on New Jersey-based Ace Fu Records, displaying a more aggressive and romantic bent to Leo's writing. In the early summer of 2001, Leo released a polished studio effort, The Tyranny of Distance, on Lookout Records. A strong contender for record of the year, it was followed by the equally strong Hearts of Oak in 2003. Shake the Sheets. which appeared in 2004, would prove to be his last for then-troubled Lookout, as Leo signed with Chicago-based indie Touch and Go in February 2006. A tour followed in March, on which he was supported by the Duke Spirit and Les Aus. He continued touring throughout 2006, festivals such as Coachella and headlining dates alike, as new material was worked on as well. Ted Leo &amp; the Pharmacists eventually returned in March 2007 with full-length number five, Living with the Living. In 2009 Leo signed with Matador, and the following year he released his first record with them, The Brutalist Bricks.</p>\n",

He graduated from Michigan State University, and before finding his niche in comedy was a clothing designer and men’s fashion buyer.<br />\nMike is the creator of the cult hit twitter feed, @DadBoner where he ghost narrates the life of Karl Welzein from a first person perspective. Karl’s story is of an affable middle-aged Midwestern man with typical Midwestern tastes, who gets sick and tired of his wife and children’s constant ridicule and decides to move in with his schlubby best friend. The feed chronicles the hilarious decline of Karl on his journey from being a Docker’s and a golf shirt-wearing Dad, to a pony tailed party maniac, spitting out his life philosophies like a modern-day Charles Bukowski, if he preferred to get drunk at Applebee’s. Mike’s depiction of Dadboner has been regaled as “a timeless work of genius” by Anthony Bourdain, and has been listed as one of “The Top 50 Funniest People Now” by Rolling Stone and “The 50 Funniest Things the Web Ever Did” by GQ Magazine.  Karl aka Dadboner aka Mike Burns published his first book, POWER MOVES: Livin’ the American Dream, USA Style, in 2013 from the Harper Collins imprint IT Books. The rights to POWER MOVES have been optioned for an animation series at Comedy Central.<br />\nMike is a regular contributor to MTV’s Ridiculousness and his on screen credits include Comedy Central, G4, and MTV.  His festival appearances include Just for Laughs Montreal New Faces, Just for Laughs Chicago, Chicago Sketchfest , New York International Fringe Festival , The DC Comedy Festival, HBO Las Vegas Comedy Festival, and Portland’s Bridgetown Comedy Festival.<br />\nMike performs comedy regularly at venues throughout Los Angeles. He loves Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bob Seger, Ric Flair, The Tigers, Wings, Lions, and 70’s-80’s muscle cars that he can’t afford. He’d like you to buy him a cold beer. Nothin’ fancy, just whatever’s on special is fine.<br />\n***<br />\n“@Dadboner is an example of a literary artifact worth preserving--perhaps worth canonizing when it&#039;s fully realized. Deeper than &quot;Family Guy&quot; or &quot;King of the Hill,&quot; @DadBoner is a Beckett in progress.” – Huffington Post<br />\n&quot;Karl Welzein&#039;s is a tale of heartbreak, persistence, pathos--and Bold Flavors. He is a Man&#039;s Man--manlier even. A True American. A Tastemaker.  His delusional optimism could be a metaphor for America. 140 characters at a time, he has gifted us with an epic unrivaled since Homer. &quot;-Anthony Bourdain<br />\n“The person behind this account is a certifiable literary genius.” -TotalFratMove.com</p>\n",

      "bio": "<p>In the decades since going solo following the success of her band 'Til Tuesday, Aimee Mann has made a name for herself as one of the greatest singer/songwriters of her generation. In 1993 and 1995 she released the albums Whatever and I'm With Stupid, and then collaborated with director Paul Thomas Anderson to contribute eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's film Magnolia. The song \"Save Me\" was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Grammy, and introduced Mann to an even wider audience. Since then, Aimee released Lost in Space (2000), 2004's Live at St. Ann's Warehouse (a live album and DVD) and the concept album The Forgotten Arm (2005). In 2005, veering farther off the beaten path, Mann released a Christmas EP, following it up in 2006 with One More Drifter in the Snow, a full-length Christmas album. Her eighth solo studio album, Charmer, came out in 2012, and her collaboration The Both with fellow Bridgetown performer Ted Leo was released in 2014.</p>\n",

I was born in Zimbabwe but I moved to America when I was 2 so I&#039;m pretty much Americanized. I&#039;ve lived all over the east coast so I have this real sweet non regional dialect that makes me sound sarcastic or cynical all the time. I think the fact that I smile a lot adds to the confusion but I digress. I love Stand Up comedy.<br />\nI like to think my act is really representative of me, it deals with where I&#039;m from, how I feel, and the person I&#039;d like to be. Boston&#039;s been pretty decent to me however I&#039;ve lately been longing for more, to be completely blunt I&#039;m tired of being seen as a &quot;novelty&quot;. But again, I digress, I love comedy. I put together my own shows because I like to see my peers have fun in an environment I know they&#039;d thrive in. In doing that I&#039;ve learned what bookers look for and how shows should be run, so the experience has helped me dramatically.<br />\nMy goals change as time progresses but right now if I could live like Jerry did on Seinfeld I think I&#039;d be satisfied with my career. A couple of late night spots, passed at some clubs, and able to live entirely off a comics salary. Besides that I just want to get better as a stand up and be around people that make me want to be better as a stand up; pretty straight forward.</p>\n",
