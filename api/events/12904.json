  "description": "<p>The Theme Park Improv Show's improvisers take a single suggestion of a theme from the audience, and wing an entire set of fast-paced long-form scenes and characters, based on stories from a special guest monologist. After a few years absence, they return to Bridgetown with a stellar lineup: John Michael Higgins (\"A Mighty Wind\"), Jessica Makinson (\"Halfway Home\"), Oscar Nunez (\"The Office\") Cole Stratton (\"Pop My Culture Podcast\") and Janet Varney (\"Burning Love\"). They'll be joined by special guest monologistÂ Hutch Harris (frontman of The Thermals)</p>\n",
