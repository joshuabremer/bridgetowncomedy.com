  "description": "<p>\"New Negro\" is a term popularized during the Harlem Renaissance to imply an outspoken intellectual departure from long-standing racist ideology and institutions. In 2017, many long-standing institutions are being called out for racist ideologies. We are just over here doing it with sillinesses and jokisms. Join Baron Vaughn as he hosts comedians departing from what you might think \"Black\" is supposed to be. So sit back and enjoy while we welcome you…to the New Negroes.</p>\n",
