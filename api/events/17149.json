  "description": "<p><strong>Reunited!</strong> brings together the casts of beloved sitcoms for in-depth panel discussions, Q &amp; A sessions, and table-reads of classic scenes.</p>\n<p>The catch? The shows never existed, except in the minds of hosts/show-creators Josh Androsky and Bryan Cook.  Additionally, none of the guests have any prior knowledge of the series they “starred” on.</p>\n<p>This show was one of the biggest hits at Bridgetown 2016, and we made it even better this year!</p>\n",
