At the beginning of their set, each comic will chug for the amount of rules broken by the comic before them (ex. If comic #2 breaks 6 rules, comic #3 drinks for 6 seconds).

Over the years, it's evolved into a weekly show and now every 1st Sunday of the month we record the show live and distribute it as a podcast.  CY has packed out Alberta Street Pub's 85 person venue on a weekly basis, for years. I would be honored to take the show to a larger venue outside of NE PDX and expand CY's reach in the scene. Since its first year running, CY has been named in the 'Top 5 Portland Comedy Showcases' which are voted on by the people. I am super proud of the work put into that stage and carefully hand select comics to create a well rounded perspective of voices. Too often local shows are booked with the same breath of comics stylings, yet at CY, audience members knows there will be a little something for everyone. Control Yourself showcase is a party, we get weird, there's an open mic after the show, the comedy lasts forever, it's always a highlight of at least 100 people's week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thank you for your consideration!</p>\n<p>\nJoAnn Schinderle</p>\n",

Again, the bell rings. More clothing is removed. This happens every time the bell is rung, and it goes as far as the comic is willing to go.  Which, in many cases, is pretty far.  Every time clothing is removed, appropriate strip club music is played to enhance the mood.  Oh yeah, there is a spinner stripper pole installed on stage for some good amateur pole work.  The show features 5 comics, one at a time.  This number could vary. There are also typically door prizes given away, which include certificates for a free lap dance from participating local strippers, or custom made butt plugs bearing the image of the headlining comic&#039;s face.</p>\n",
