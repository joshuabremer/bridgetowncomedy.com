  "bio": "<p>In Reading the Bible With Dan Live, Dan Weber and his comedy writing partner “The Bible” and his co-host Nariko Ott dissect the most popular stories found in the wacky insanity that is America&#039;s Most Revered Book. We read stories such as Adam and Eve getting thrown out of the garden of Eden; Noah&#039;s Ark and the flood; Cain and Abel; Jacob tricking Issac to become the father of the nation of Israel, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  Joining them is a rotating panel of comics who comment on each and every crazy thing read. </p>\n<p>Panelists have included Amy Miller, Christian Ricketts, Whitney Streed and Kristine Levine.</p>\n<p>Musical accompaniment provided by Ira Novos.</p>\n<p>It&#039;s slightly informative and super hilarious.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the live show has a drinking game named &quot;Behold!&quot; Every time that word is used in the Bible, the audience takes a drink. This happens way more than it really should.</p>\n<p>There really isn&#039;t anything else like it.</p>\n<p>For the Bridgetown show we would read about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah because that story is absolutely insane.</p>\n",
