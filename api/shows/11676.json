  "bio": "In Reading the Bible With Dan Live, Dan Weber and his comedy writing partner “The Bible” and his co-host Nariko Ott dissect the most popular stories found in the wacky insanity that is America&#039;s Most Revered Book. We read stories such as Adam and Eve getting thrown out of the garden of Eden; Noah&#039;s Ark and the flood; Cain and Abel; Jacob tricking Issac to become the father of the nation of Israel, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  Joining them is a rotating panel of comics who comment on each and every crazy thing read. \r\n\r\nPanelists have included Amy Miller, Christian Ricketts, Whitney Streed and Kristine Levine.\r\n\r\nMusical accompaniment provided by Ira Novos.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s slightly informative and super hilarious.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the live show has a drinking game named &quot;Behold!&quot; Every time that word is used in the Bible, the audience takes a drink. This happens way more than it really should.\r\n\r\nThere really isn&#039;t anything else like it.\r\n\r\nFor the Bridgetown show we would read about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah because that story is absolutely insane.",
