  "copy": "The Theme Park Improv Show&#039;s improvisers take a single suggestion of a theme from the audience, and wing an entire set of fast-paced long-form scenes and characters, based on stories from a special guest monologist. After a few years absence, they return to Bridgetown with a stellar lineup: Rachel Dratch (&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;),  John Michael Higgins (&quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;),  Jessica Makinson (&quot;Halfway Home&quot;), Oscar Nunez (&quot;The Office&quot;) Cole Stratton (&quot;Pop My Culture Podcast&quot;) and Janet Varney (&quot;Burning Love&quot;).
