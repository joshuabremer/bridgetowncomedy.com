For its 2016 Bridgetown edition, Theme Park includes John Michael Higgins (Best In Show, Arrested Development), Oscar Nuñez (The Office), Janet Varney (You're The Worst, The Legend of Korra), Jessica Makinson (South Park, Maron), Cole Stratton (RiffTrax, Pop My Culture) and surprise guests.</p>\n",
  "copy": "<p>The Theme Park Improv Show's improvisers take a single suggestion of a theme from the audience, and wing an entire set of fast-paced long-form scenes and characters, based on stories from a special guest monologist. After a few years absence, they return to Bridgetown with a stellar lineup: John Michael Higgins (\"A Mighty Wind\"), Jessica Makinson (\"Halfway Home\"), Oscar Nunez (\"The Office\") Cole Stratton (\"Pop My Culture Podcast\") and Janet Varney (\"Burning Love\"). They'll be joined by special guest monologists James Urbaniak (\"Venture Bros.\" -- Saturday show) and more!</p>\n",
