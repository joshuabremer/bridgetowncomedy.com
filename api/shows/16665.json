  "bio": "<p>Simultaneously one of the best and the absolute WORST comedy shows in Portland, No Pun Intendo happens in the corner bar area of Ground Kontrol. No Pun Intendo has spent the last 6 years giving comedians panic attacks of varying gravity, but it’s the show to see if you really want to see them try. It’s a great challenge for comedians—an exercise in hard consonants, volume control gimmicks, and the confidence to believe the few people gathered around the tables are really really with them. It’s where you can see a comic give everything they have, amidst complete chaos, on one of the longest running shows in town.</p>\n",
  "copy": "<p>Stand-Up Comics &amp; Stand-Up Games! No Pun Intendo brings fantastic comedians to Ground Kontrol, a bar arcade downtown, and one of Portland’s most wonderful places.! Ground Kontrol also has great nachos, and you can shoot for high scores on all the best old games. Plus we occasionally have video game competitions between audience members with fabulous prizes!<br />\nEach month, we feature fantastic comics from Portland &amp; beyond.</p>\n",
