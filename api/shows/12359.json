  "bio": "<p>Uncalled Four is one of the best interactive shows in the country, with fest attendees contributing, voting, and winning prizes. We also highlight the city we&#039;re in, soliciting local businesses for quirky and awesome prizes, trying to find the &quot;weird&quot; where you live. But above all that, it&#039;s the comics who love doing the show. Competition brings out the best in them. In short, it&#039;s a fun and dirty comedy game show where everyone wins.</p>\n",
  "copy": "<p>Half stand up, half game show, Uncalled Four is an interactive crowd experience. Comedians write a deck of 20 terrible/hilarious answers to audience questions like &quot;What does Trump&#039;s hair smell like?&quot; or &quot;Dad went out to buy _____ and never came back.&quot; Comedians each submit a card while we give out a prize each round, then fan reaction determines the winner. After 30 minutes, comics can wager points in the final &quot;Degenerate Gambler&quot; round to see who will be The Worst Person.</p>\n",
