  "bio": "<p>Comedy Legend Bobcat Goldthwait and Caitlin Gill (Take My Wife writer, also Bobcat's roommate) gather some of the most eclectic personalities around, and bring together a comedy/variety show that celebrates everyone's own wierdness and individuality. Its common to find Drag Queens, Standups, Poets, and modern dancers all on one show, while tieing together a common theme. </p>\n<p>Named one of the best local shows in Los Angeles by LA WEEKLY, Crabapples has sold out at SF Sketchfest and RIOT LA Fest this year, and will be touring this year!</p>\n",
  "copy": "<p>Bobcat Goldthwait and Caitlin Gill are friends. They have other friends too. Friends who are top notch comedians. Come see friends with their friends being friends! FRIENDS!</p>\n<p>Crabapples brings together the comedians that Bobcat and Caitlin admire and love to watch. Because Blobcat and Caitfin came up in different eras and in different scenes, the show is full of comics you've known and loved for years, and the comics you will learn about and love for years to come. Bloatcarb and Cakebinge invite you to join the party every week, but especially THIS SHOW</p>\n",
