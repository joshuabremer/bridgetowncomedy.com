The audience decides the winner by applause at the end of every round, until we have one final champion. It's like 8 Mile, but funny. Past competitors include Reggie Watts, TJ Miller, Childish Gambino, Thomas Middleditch, Pete Holmes, MC Chris, Nicole Parker, Megan Amram, and like a billion other people. Hosted by Eliza Skinner.</p>\n",
