  "bio": "<p>Earthquake Hurricane is Portland's comedy super-group comprised of Bri Pruett, Alex Falcone, Katie Nguyen, and Anthony Lopez. We stand out from the crowded Portland comedy scene because of our group hosting. We open and close the show with a discussion of the biggest (and smallest) issues of the day, riffing with each other and our audience. In addition to being consistently ranked as some of the best comics in the city, we also have more than two decades of combined improv experience.</p>\n<p>We're also known around Portland for being the toughest showcase to get on, as our lineups are the most consistently strong of any show. Comics tell us they knew they were going to have a future in comedy the first time they got asked to do our show.</p>\n",
