  "bio": "<p><strong>Reunited!</strong> brings together the casts of beloved sitcoms for in-depth panel discussions, Q &amp; A sessions, and table-reads of classic scenes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The catch? The shows never existed, except in the minds of hosts/show-creators Josh Androsky and Bryan Cook.  Additionally, none of the guests have any prior knowledge of the series they “starred” on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cook and Androsky create a fictionalized world where a panel of comics discuss personal issues, professional pitfalls, and brushes with the law. It would be the most scandalous show in Hollywood if any of it had ever happened.</p>\n",
  "copy": "<p>The show debuted to a sold-out crowd at the Hollywood Improv Lab in February of 2016. Bryan Cook and Josh Androsky are well-known Los Angeles comics, writers, and live show producers. Cook founded and hosts Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction, as well as weekly standup showcase ‘Big Money Comedy,’ at The Virgil in Los Angeles. He has written for JASH, Funny or Die, and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. Androsky co-hosts weekly standup showcase ‘Babe Island,’ has appeared on ‘This American Life,’ and written for Billy on the Street and Spongebob Squarepants.</p>\n",
