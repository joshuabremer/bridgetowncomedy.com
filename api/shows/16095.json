  "bio": "<p>7 Minutes in Purgatory challenges comedians to perform directly to a camera alone in a soundproof room, while audience members watch a live feed in another room. This social experiment/comedy show offers a chance to watch performers hilariously and awkwardly attempt to do their act without the benefit of audience feedback. The show, which was described by the Laugh Button as \"one of the coolest and most creative additions to the comedy world,\" is a Comedy Central digital series and has appeared at festivals like Moontower, SXSW, Bridgetown, The Onion &amp; AV Club's 2nd &amp; 3rd Annual 26th Annual Comedy Festival, Just For Laughs, High Plains, RIOT LA, and the New York Comedy Festival.</p>\n",
