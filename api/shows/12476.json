Contestants offer their heated opinions on subjects--some prepared, some improvised--and then, like ice cream to a hot pepper so foolishly eaten whole, sooth their raw nerves by dancing to music they may or may not know. Judgement is summarily doled out panel-style. Winners receive little but pride and regrets. Great fun is had by all.<br />\nRants Off / Dance Off has been a part of Portland&#039;s Bridgetown Comedy Festival and All Jane Comedy Festival, as well as Bumbershoot in Seattle.
