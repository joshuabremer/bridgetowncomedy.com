It&#039;s a standup show with a strong emphasis on group hosting, starting with a group riff at the top and bottom of the show, and audience participation during those sessions. Oh yeah, and we&#039;re in a bike shop / bar which is the most Portland thing ever.\r\n\r\nIn the year since we started we&#039;ve become a staple of the Portland scene including Willamette Week&#039;s pick for best comedy show, Portland Mercury picks, and a feature in The Portland Monthly.",
