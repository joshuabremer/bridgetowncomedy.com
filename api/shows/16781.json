  "bio": "<p>I've been running my stand up showcase, Control Yourself, for 3full years now. Over the years, it's evolved into a weekly show and now every 1st Sunday of the month we record the show live and distribute it as a podcast.  CY has packed out Alberta Street Pub's 85 person venue on a weekly basis, for years. I would be honored to take the show to a larger venue outside of NE PDX and expand CY's reach in the scene. Since its first year running, CY has been named in the 'Top 5 Portland Comedy Showcases' which are voted on by the people. I am super proud of the work put into that stage and carefully hand select comics to create a well rounded perspective of voices. Too often local shows are booked with the same breath of comics stylings, yet at CY, audience members knows there will be a little something for everyone. Control Yourself showcase is a party, we get weird, there's an open mic after the show, the comedy lasts forever, it's always a highlight of at least 100 people's week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thank you for your consideration!</p>\n<p>\nJoAnn Schinderle</p>\n",
