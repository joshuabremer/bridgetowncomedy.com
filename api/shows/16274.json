  "bio": "<p>Hello! I struggled with which show to submit but figured since Midnight Mass is so late and can accomodate so many sets, it was a better bet (Also Whitney gave me advice). The 2016 turnout was PACKED, even in extreme Analog heat, and for the most part we were able to draw our old Midnight Mass/ Amy Miller fan crowd. My pitch is that it's FUN, people love it, and it's only mildly themed but also another straight standup set for everybody!</p>\n",
  "copy": "<p>Midnight Mass is one of Portland's most beloved shows of all time! Alongside renowned pianist and Chicago comedian Ira Novos, Amy Miller hosts a raucous late night showcase that features a diverse range of comedy styles, voices, and drunkenness levels. The show is punctuated with a couple of loosely churchy rituals, like a pre-show greeting/ peace be with you, and confessions from the audience. Midnight Ma$$ has been home to many a storied drop-in, including Norm Macdonald, Rory Scovel, and Dave Attell. MM was voted Best Local Comedy Show in the Willamette Week readers' poll.I</p>\n",
