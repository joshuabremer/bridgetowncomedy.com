  "bio": "<p>Midnight Mass is one of Portland's most beloved shows of all time! Alongside renowned pianist and Chicago comedian Ira Novos, Amy Miller hosts a raucous late night showcase that features a diverse range of comedy styles, voices, and drunkenness levels. The show is punctuated with a couple of loosely churchy rituals, like a pre-show greeting/ peace be with you, and confessions from the audience. Midnight Ma$$ has been home to many a storied drop-in, including Norm Macdonald, Rory Scovel, and Dave Attell. MM was voted Best Local Comedy Show in the Willamette Week readers' poll.</p>\n",
