THE GUEST LIST is a stand-up comedy showcase presented by and recorded for Audible. Based in San Francisco, this showcase is produced all over town - secret speakeasies, hidden clubs and in the basements of the best comedy clubs. You’ve got to be on the guest list to get into THE GUEST LIST and for the first time, the show leaves SF and comes north for Bridgetown!
