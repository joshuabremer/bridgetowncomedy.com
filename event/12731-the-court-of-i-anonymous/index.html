The long-running Portland Mercury column “I, Anonymous” is famous for allowing readers to send in their most whacked-out rants and confessions—anonymously and without being judged. NO LONGER! In “The Portland Mercury Presents: The Court of I, Anonymous,” judge/host Bri Pruett will read some of the wildest, uncensored I, Anonymous submissions ever, which will then be judged by our hilarious jury, Greg Behrendt, Clare O’Kane, and Curtis Cook. Watch some of the funniest people alive judge the most awful people ever for your fun and enjoyment!
