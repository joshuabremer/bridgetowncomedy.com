Minority Retort is the NW's premier standup showcase featuring comedians of color! Hosted by comedian Jeremy Eli and co-produced by writer/radio show host Jason Lamb, Minority Retort's goal is to provide performers with a platform to speak their minds and share their unique perspectives, as well as reach the multicultural comedy audience that exists within the so-called "whitest city in America".
