"New Negro" is a term popularized during the Harlem Renaissance to imply an outspoken intellectual departure from long-standing racist ideology and institutions.

Join Baron Vaughn as he hosts comedians departing from what you might think "Black" is supposed to be. So sit back and enjoy while we welcome you…to the New Negroes.
