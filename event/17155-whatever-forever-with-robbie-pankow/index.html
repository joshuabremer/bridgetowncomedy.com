Whatever Forever is a monthly comedy showcase based out of Portland, OR. Every month our host, Robbie Pankow, consumes something truly awful(like extremely hot sauces or whatever new invention Taco Bell has come up with) for the entertainment of YOU, the fans, while our favorite stand up comics wow you with their funniest jokes!
